Release Notes
The current version of OBI.owl provided at the site is still a draft. In
fact, it is a pre-release version that is meant for review and could
change substantially after review. The current version however
represents the efforts from the different OBI branch development as
provided at
http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/branchDevelopment/trunk/ on
Mar 03, 2008.
The release consists in several files:
- OBI.owl
The merged file representing the current status of the project, created
by merging the branches together.
This file is OWL-DL and consistent.
- OBI-ProtegeFriendly.owl
Due to a bug in Protege 3.x, the namespaces are not properly handled in
the OWL-DL version.
We therefore produce as a temporary fix a Protege friendly version, wich
is consistent but OWL-Full.
This will allow the disply via label instead of IDs in Protege 3.x
- md5.txt
This file contains an md5 checksum computed from OBI.owl. It is intended
as an integrity check of your download, and is the first step towards a
versioning control system.
It will most probably be modified in its structure in the following
releases.
