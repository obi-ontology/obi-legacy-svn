format_standard	format standard	http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl	ObsoleteClass		http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl					a format standard is a digital entity that consists of rules applied to information, as opposed to rules applied to objects (which are termed plans)				PERSON:Chris Stoeckert	PERSON:Jennifer Fostel	
number	number	http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl					Was 'value'				PERSON:Chris Stoeckert					A number is an information content entity which provides a magnitude for the result of a measurement.
OBI_900004	instrument part function	http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl	ObsoleteClass		http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl	E.g. the function of the electromagnetic lenses in an electron microscope to direct the incident electron beam trajectory so as to systematically raster across a specimen when constructing the overall image; the function of Nomarksi optics to enhance the constrast of specimens viewed in a light microscope based on their ability to refract visible wavelengths of light.		instrument part function			Bill Bug	PERSON:William Bug@2007/07/10	definition_incomplete			A function inhering the cardinal part of an instrument necessary for that instrument to participate in critical process in the context of a specific investigation plan.
OBI_900001	reagent function	http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl	ObsoleteClass		http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl	E.g. the function of Cy5 coupled-ligands to enable separation of cells in a Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) by virtue of cells possessing specific receptors with an specific affinity to bind the coupled ligand thereby causing only those cells to fluoresce when illuminated with laser light frequency that specifically excites Cy5, triggering relays and redirecting the solution flow to a separate effluent container.		reagent function			Bill Bug	PERSON:William Bug@2007/07/10	definition_incomplete			A function inhering a molecule, set of molecules, cell, collection of cells, or tissue  enabling it to participate in critical material transformation in the context of a specific investigation plan.
OBI_900007	dialysis tubing function	http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl	ObsoleteClass		http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl			dialysis tubing function	dialysis tubing function			PERSON:William Bug@2007/07/10				
OBI_900005	labware function	http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl	ObsoleteClass		http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl	E.g. the function of semi-permeable dialysis tubing to separate solutes based on size by virtue of restricted diffusion and osmosis; the function of a plastic 25 ml centrifuge tube to act as an inert storage vessel for a material sample.	How does this relate to an object such as the enzyme-coated plate used in an ELISA protocol application?  The plate itself is a type of labware, but the enzyme is a reagent.(BB:2007-07-10).	labware function			Bill Bug	PERSON:William Bug@2007/07/10	definition_incomplete			A function inhering in a type of labware enabling it to participate in critical process in the context of a specific investigation plan.
OBI_900003	instrument platform function	http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl	ObsoleteClass		http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl	E.g. the function of a high pressure liquid chromatagraphic (HPLC) system to separate molecules based on their solubility properties		instrument platform function			Bill Bug	PERSON:William Bug@2007/07/10	definition_incomplete			A function inhering an instrument_platform enabling it to participate in critical process in the context of a specific investigation plan.
OBI_900006	analytical instrument function	http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl	ObsoleteClass		http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl	E.g. the function of a spectrophotometer to provide a measure of the relative absorbance of a liquid sample for a particular wavelength (or set of wavelengths) of light.		analytical instrument function			Bill Bug	PERSON:William Bug@2007/07/10	definition_incomplete			An instrument function where the process in which the instrument participates results in a quality measurement of the material under examination which is critical in the context of a specific investigation plan.
