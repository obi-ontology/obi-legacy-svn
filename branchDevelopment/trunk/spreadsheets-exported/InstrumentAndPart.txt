The lamp consists of two electrodes typically made of tungsten which are separated by a gas. The type of lamp is often named by the gas contained in the bulb; including neon, argon, xenon, krypton, sodium, metal halide, and mercury. The electric arc in an arc lamp consists of gas which is initially ionized by a voltage and is therefore electrically conductive. To start an arc lamp, usually a very high voltage is needed to ignite or strike the arc. This requires an electrical circuit sometimes called an igniter, which is part of a larger circuit called the ballast. The ballast supplies a suitable voltage and current to the lamp as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Older cytometers may use arc lamps to irradiate particles at the interogation point.				John Quinn			arc_lamp	graph_position_temporary

Commonly optical subsystems consist of an excitation optics and collection optics. The excitation optics of a flow cytometer optical subsystem consist of the laser and lenses that are used to shape and focus the laser beam. The collections optics consist of a collection lens to collect light emitted from the particle laser beam interaction and a system of optical mirrors and filters to route specified wavelengths of the collected light to designated optical detectors. The optical subsystem in a flow cytometer consists of the equipment used to irradiate particles, and collect the light either emmitted or scattered by those particles.
