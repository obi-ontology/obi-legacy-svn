Release Notes, OBI owl:versionInfo 0.6.7

The current version of OBI.owl provided at the site is still a draft. 
In fact, it is a pre-release version that is meant for review and 
could change substantially after review. The current version however 
represents the efforts from the different OBI branch development as 
provided at http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/branchDevelopment/trunk/
  on Jan 15, 2008. A new draft release of OBI.owl is planned for 
February 2008 that has undergone review but not necessarily validated 
against use cases and competency questions.
