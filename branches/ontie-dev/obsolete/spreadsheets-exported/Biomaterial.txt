Each viral particle, or virion, consists of genetic material, DNA or RNA, within a protective protein coat called a capsid. The capsid shape varies from simple helical and icosahedral (polyhedral or near-spherical) forms, to more complex structures with tails or an envelope. Viruses infect cellular life forms and are grouped into animal, plant and bacterial types, according to the type of host infected. Viruses must replicate in a living cell, as they cannot carry out metabolic processes on their own.	merged Maura Gasparetto _ Helen Parkinson\nMC: A virus is not an orgnism		Melanie Courtot	Maura Gasparetto									virus	definition_incomplete
