<h3>Minimal requirement for term annotations in OBI (metadata)</h3>

<p class="tightenable">This list represents the mandatory and optional metadata for representational units as agreed by the OBI coordinator committee.&nbsp;<br>
The proposed cardinalities are
indicated in
front of the name of the annotation property. Some are however still
under discussion.</p>

<h4>Mandatory metadata: MUST be provided</h4>

<ul>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">1: <b>preferred_term</b>:
The concise, meaningful, and human-friendly name for a class or
property preferred by the ontology developers. (US-English)</li>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">1: <b>definition</b>:
The official
OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property. Shall be
Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with informal
definitions to further explain the meaning of the term.</li>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">1,*: <b>definition_editor</b>:
The name of the editor of the definition.</li>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">1: <b>definition_source</b>:
An
unambiguous and traceable reference to the source of the definition.
Examples: ISBN, URI plus date, MeSH Term, PUBMED ID, DOI.</li>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">1,*: <b>curation_status</b>:
The
curation status of a class or property. The allowed values come from an
enumerated list of predefined terms. Examples: raw import, obo
definition incomplete, graph position temporary, uncurated, curation
approved</li>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">1,*: <b>example</b>:
A phrase
describing how a term should be used. May also include other kinds of
examples, such as widely known subclasses or instances of the class.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Optional metadata: SHOULD be provided</h4>

<ul>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">0,*: <b>alternative_term</b>:
An alternative name for a class or property which means the same thing,
i.e. semantically equivalent, as the preferred_term.</li>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">0,*: <b>alternative_term_tag</b>:
A tag to indicate sets of alternative terms. Examples:
toxicogenomics_community, abbreviation.</li>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">0,*: <b>alternative_term_source</b>:
An unambiguous and traceable reference to the source of the
alternative_term. Examples: ISBN, URI plus date, MeSH Term, PUBMED ID,
DOI.</li>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">0,*: <b>editor_note</b>:
An
administrative note intended for the editor. It will not be included in
the publication version of the ontology, so it should contain nothing
necessary for end users to understand the ontology.</li>

  <li class="tightenable top bottom">0,1: <b>external_class</b>:
An annotation property that indicates external classes, including their
subtrees, for a given anchor class.</li>

</ul>
