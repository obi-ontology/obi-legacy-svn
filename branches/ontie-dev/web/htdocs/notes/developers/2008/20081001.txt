Question about the mini use case page suggested by Bjoern:
Bjoern clarified that this was a separate effort. If these turn out to be useful to the manuscript we can feed into that process. For the manuscript we do reports on three separate community driven use cases, that will demonstrate the broad applicability and usefulness of OBI.
