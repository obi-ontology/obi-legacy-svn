OBI developers call Feb 6, 2008
Attending: Chris S, Philippe R-S, Melanie C, Helen P, Daniel S, Bjoern
P, Allyson L, Ryan B, Gilberto F, Liju F, Tina B

1. March 1 pre-draft release. Melanie, Alan, and Bill will jointly
work out technical issues for generating a release of OBI so that a
pre-draft version is available March 1. As part of this effort,
Melanie will draft a proposal to circulate for approval on ID usage
post March 1. Once approved this policy will be posted (by Frank) in
the methodology section of the wiki.
2. Obsolete classes. Will not worry about deleted classes prior to
March 1. After that, need to agree on policy (obsolete class,
annotation tag, or tag to generate obsolete class in owl). Gilberto
will send out mail outlining the issue for discussion.
3. Sourceforge tracker items. All items have been assigned based on
which branch they belong to (so please check to see what you were
volunteered for ;-) ). http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=177891&atid=886178
4. Cross-products. A mechanism for quick term submission and review
has been proposed (see http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=177891&atid=886178)
. Initially this could for expedited review but in the long term may
enable term insertion into OBI without review. Philippe will draft a
proposal to circulate for approval. Once approved this policy will be
posted (by Frank) in the methodology section of the wiki.
