FuGO Conference Call - 01/25/06Participants: Joe Wood, Philippe Rocca-Serra, Jennifer Fostel, Tanya Gray, Daniel Schober, Trish Whetzel, Susanna Sansone, Gilberto Fragoso, Mervi Heiskanen, Chris Stoeckert, Ryan Brinkman, Joe Spidlen, Liju Fan, Dawn Field, Helen Causton, Tina BoussardAgenda: -Review the Current Top Nodes-Review term lists from communities - Flow Cytometry=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Review Current Top nodes:Object: An independent entity which endures as one and the same through time while perhaps undergoing changes, e.g. organism, petri dish, database, laboratory, organ, organ part, cellCharacteristic: A dependent entity which endures as one and the same through time while perhaps undergoing changes (e.g. the height of this organism, the mass of this petri dish, the function of this organ)Process: An entity which unfolds itself through time in successive phases or temporal stages (e.g. sleeping, measuring, dying, dividing, switching on, switching off, the functioning of this organ)(fugo-devel thread - http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=14521281)-Review term lists from communities - Flow CytometryThe file FaceOntology.v0.4.OTop50.xls  posted at:http://fugo.sourceforge.net/ontology/conceptList/was presented.Discussion:-Do all terms fit under the existing top nodes? Yes-How are instruments described, is the part-of relation used? Not used currently, but probably will be needed.-Location of Measurement descriptor? these are under Characteristic and are further down the tree so they are not in this list-Scope of FACE - focus on technology for now, look to FuGO for the general terms-Have you put this in OWL to review the is-a relations? Yes, this is available at www.flowcyt.org-Inclusion of "Descriptor" in the term name, e.g. Experiment_Descriptor and FCM_Experiment_Descriptor? It is ok since these are not the top nodes.-Goal of term list - focus on the work that the community knows best-Descriptor - propose to use Characteristic or Attribute, e.g. change Experiment_Descriptor to Experiment_Characteristic OR Experiment_Attribute with the top node being the suffix of whichever is chosen-note - it is better to use the singular form of the word as the term name-Data - where is this? under Characteristic, this is further down the tree than the "Top 50" and can be seen in the OWL file-Location of 'universal' terms in FuGO - this may vary from community to community as the term lists are generated, therefore keep an eye on this.-How does FACE handle concept of "Time"? this is further down the tree as time-related/dependent entity is in ProcessUpdates from Community Coordinators:-Proteomics and Polymorphism communities will be able to present their lists next week.  Metabolomics group are gathering terms for NMR technology.News:Ryan has started to generate a combination list of the terms currently posted on the fugo site.  Are others ready to proceed with reviewing the combination list or is time to review the individual lists from the community preferred? Consensus - continue to review the individual lists from the community and the work of combining the various term lists will be slated for the FuGO workshop.  In the meantime, the current list that Ryan has generated is posted at:http://fugo.sourceforge.net/ontology/conceptList/ and is called top50comboRB.xls
