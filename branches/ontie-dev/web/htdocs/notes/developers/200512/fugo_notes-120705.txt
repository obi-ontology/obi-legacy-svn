FuGO Call - 120705

Particpants: Gilberto, Mervi, Liju, Ryan, Normann, Chris T, Trish, Joe

Agenda: Review Proteomics Use Cases

Use Case 1 - Compare schizophrenic and ‘normal’ brains
note that there is no within gel comparison of the samples
DIGE - something can be labeled with any of the dyes

Concepts with external ontologies
-Anatomy
-Clinical diagnosis

Images of the gel are obtained - will the images be stored in the repository?
Software apps have many params - there are plans to capture the name and version of the software, but the param information collection has not yet been determined and depends on the needs of the community

Discussion on Equipment and Equipment Part
It was suggested that the use of the part-Of relation be used to fit together the separate instrument parts that make up the actual configuration of the instrument that is used.  The same is true of building up a descriptor for LC/MS/MS.

Use Case 2 - Plasma and serum proteome surveys, with four-dimensional separation
there is a description of the samples generated by the HUPO HPPP, can this doc in it's entirety be referenced or do experiments that use this sample have to re-describe this everytime?

analysis - heat map may be generated, but this may not be included in the repository so it is unclear the need of a vocab for this. 

MIAPE-compliance - another source of terms will be the set of documents being collected from researchers that describe the assay design information.  This is being collected in free text.

Use Case 3 - Localisation of organelle proteins by (ICAT) isotope tagging
the use of this technology is valuable because the ion intensities between 2 runs of a mass spec can not be determined with certainty due to too many variables

in preparing the density gradient it is important to know fine detail about the centrifugation such as the time, speed, what rotor is use

serial pipetting - this is done on a volume basis, remove the first 70ml etc.

Review of Use Cases with respect to developing FuGO in a unified model
concepts presented in this appear to work fine in a unified model

there is still an interest to provide a mapping from FuGO to any given object model to facilitate the usage of the ontology with the object models

there is work being done on upper level ontologies where the use of relations that are present in the upper level ontology would be worthwhile to use in FuGO
