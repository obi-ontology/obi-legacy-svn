Developers Call - 22NOV2006

Participants: Chris Stoeckert (CS), Bill Bug (BB), Daniel Schober (DS), Liju Fan (LF), Trish Whetzel (TW), Bjoern Peters (BP), Ryan Brinkman (RB), Kevin Clancy (KC)

Agenda: Review metadata terms listed at:
https://www.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/RepresentationalUnitMetadataTable


Summary from Bill
-requirements gathering
-implementation that maximizes our interoperability, reduce redundancy within ourselves and other projects
-re-organize with those that are lexical, admin/editorial, structural


BB - how we will interoperate with SKOS, more use in the community
-UMLS will move into RDF and be used with SKOS according to Olivier Bodenreider
-no way to subclass in OWL 1.0 without going into OWL-Full

DS - scope of SKOS is for big terminologies like UMLS
BB - no, that is not true. if there isn't a formalism that helps separate the formalism from the lexical graph then it makes more work for the consumer. SKOS has been around for ~30 years and has absorbed what is needed by the community. To use right now, need to use annotation property as is and can't subclass.

CS - don't hear a disagreement and want to move on. The list seems comprehensive but needs work.

LF - find the minimal terms.

BB - review write-up from the 42 terms and which are really required

=-=-=-=-=-=
-class_identifier - not needed for Min Required (MR), using rdf:ID

-class_name_preferred - re-name to prefLabel
--What is meant here? Highest use, is most intuitive? 
LF- need a better term name, no underscores in the term name, as seen in the text
DS - then we loose the order of the properties, if use NLP term names
LF - does each community have a prefLabel or are these synonyms?
BB - should have only 1 prefLabel and is just a consensus of the group
Refine Def - BB Action Item

-class_name_abbreviation - not needed
TW - is this a min term that we need right now?
All - no
DS - skip abbrev and acronym as well

-class_name_synonym
not required field for every term
LF - we need this 
BB - MR is the minimum for RU file but not required for every field
DS - if min for RU file, and then what needs to be attached to a term 
TW - re-name term to synonym and use qualifier example as demo by Gilberto, definition, source and defprov of the synonym
DS - is there a need to discriminate between annotation properties as applied to classes and terms and instances?
BB - no, this is not needed, agreement by LF and TW

TW - keep mentioning them RU_metadata file, will OBI import the ru_metadata file?
CS - don't see the issue
LF - the file will not be very big and will not be a problem, if we import then development becomes tricky 
BB - they will be developed in synch and it will be fine
CS - is there a consensus?
LF - would like to hear from Gilberto before making a decision
Action Item - consult with Gilberto about importing the ru_metadata file into OBI  at this point in time.

CS - proposal for preferred name is to apply this to classes and properties


-class_parent_old - 
TW - is this needed at this point in time, i.e. is this a minimal term to include? OBI is not yet in production and is not deprecating terms in a way that is computationally accessible. This is a decision that we made early in development. When OBI is in production use, terms will be deprecated in a way that is computationally accessible. 
LF - agree to not use at this time, implementing now causes unnecessary overhead
TW - suggest to define a Deprecation Policy and identify tags needed from there, e.g. https://www.cbil.upenn.edu/magewiki/index.php/TermDeprecationPolicy



-class_refactored
BB - define to better, does this mean the term was split?
DS - better name
TW - not needed at this time as part of the minimal set of terms since this is part of a Deprecation Policy

-class_replaced - not needed
CS - defer these for now since this will be part of the Deprecation Policy

-class_provenance
BB - need to track as an ID and a name of the resource, UMLS gives a good way to indicate this
LF - should be consistent with the synonym proposal, there is also class_source, owl:imports
CS - track provenance in a different way?
BB - clear on provenance for definitions but not for terms
DS - thought this would be for any terms for the class, this needs to be more clear

CS - defer these terms on class provenance, get input from Gilberto
BB - the owl:imports issue is different from this term

-class_deleted - discuss as part of Deprecation Policy
-property_deleted - discuss as part of Deprecation Policy

-property_name_preferred, property_identifier, property_provenance, property_definition - use the same annotation property for these types as used for classes, i.e remove the term type from the annotation property


-definition 
LF - the definition is used in the 
DS - this o
TW - prefer name of obo_definition

-editor_note - needs to be defined 

-change_note - use with deprecated class?

-curation_status
TW - use with mini CV that BIRN has set-up, i.e. set as a Datatype annotation property and set the XML Schema datatype
BB or DS - can we have strings as symbols?

-scope_note - check with Gilberto as to the usage. notes on previous wiki page indicate that this is in the list of terms proposed by Gilberto and he suggests calling this design_note

-UMLS_link - drop for now

-action_item - short term vs. the long term aspect for editor_note

-unresolved_issue
BP - merge with action_item
