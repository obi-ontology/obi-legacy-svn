Chris, Alli, Jennifer, Alan 

now posted on wiki; review and discuss next time: Barry presentation on partitions and

Kevin's OWL file for the branch 

Chris has annotated the excel list of terms on Google Docs to identify agreement and disagreement between his and Christian's assignments of terms collected by Jennifer 

We will have terms for other branches, primarily roles / qualities / plan branches 

We distinguish reality and info about reality

measurement, value, qualitative value belong in our branch

and are related to qualities in real world through relationship 

Chris posted his first example for discussion

AR:  ¡Èabove normal¡É is not a measurement; it is a calculation

CS, JF: we use this as data; observation

AR: agree with approach; watch for loss of connection with quality 

CS: where do numbers and units go?

AR:  dimensions are what units are of

number = digital object

information = 1 meter = 39 inches; belongs in our branch 

AR: units are a social construct

dimensions are owned by physicists 

CS: example 2 - images, figures, likelihood scores

relations needed:

quality XX is_recorded_with information object YY

unit to dimension

AR recap:

Level 1: the objects, processes, qualities, states, etc. in reality (for example on the side of the patient);

* Level 2: cognitive representations of this reality on the part of researchers and others;

* Level 3: concretizations of these cognitive representations in (for example textual or graphical) representational artifacts. 

AR: overlaps his work with SWAN; how to relate level 3 things to level 1 things 

AR: write 3 - 4 examples of what we want to express

AR: homework for CS; definitions from his examples 

we also need to cover formats of documents 

next call in two weeks; sept 13 thursday 9:30; CS: arrange calendar 

JF needs to look into mailing list with help form AL; be sure all areon list

CS will compare Kevin's OWl file and the DE Branch OWL file in SVN 

agenda next call -- cleaning up our owl SVN file once we decide which terms belong
