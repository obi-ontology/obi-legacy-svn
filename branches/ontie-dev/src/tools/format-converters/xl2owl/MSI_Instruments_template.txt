It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column.

Pulsed Electrochemical Detection (PED) allows simple, sensitive, and direct detection of numerous polar aliphatic compounds, especially carbohydrates. This technique exploits the electrocatalytic activity of noble metal electrode surfaces to oxidize various polar functional groups. In PED, multi-step potential-time waveforms at Au and Pt electrodes realize amperometric/coulometric detection while maintaining uniform and reproducible electrode activity. The response mechanisms in PED are dominated by the surface properties of the electrode, and, as a consequence, members of each chemical class of compounds produce virtually identical voltammetric responses. Thus, the full potential is realized when combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

The strength of the AED lies in the detector's ability to simultaneously determine the atomic emissions of many of the elements in analytes that elute from a GC capillary column (called eluants or solutes in some books). As eluants come off the capillary column they are fed into a microwave powered plasma (or discharge) cavity where the compounds are destroyed and their atoms are excited by the energy of the plasma. The light that is emitted by the excited particles is separated into individual lines via a photodiode array. The associated computer then sorts out the individual emission lines and can produce chromatograms made up of peaks from eluants that contain only a specific element."

Physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the FID but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. The nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. It is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. If the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. If the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. The heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. These electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. When a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. The adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. The sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2.

Evoked by many exciting applications, there is a need for analytical methods which require less amounts of sample. Bruker BioSpin meets this challenge with a revolutionary NMR probe design: The 1mm MicroProbe. It operates with disposable 1mm capillary sample tubes and the sample volume of 5 microliters enables the use of lowest amounts of sample to run all high resolution NMR experiments with outstanding sensitivity and up to 16 times faster measurements. Due to the TXI-type probe design, the z-gradient coil and the automatic matching and tuning accessory, the 1mm MicroProbe can be used for a wide variety of NMR experiments. The key advantages of this probe include:\n   up to 4 times higher mass sensitivity than 5mm conventional probes (with respect to the same sample amount)\n   excellent solvent suppression properties\n   virtually no salt effect\n   discrete samples in tubes that can be sealed and stored\n   automation accessory for sample preparation and handling available\n   defprov: Bruker website"		GROUP:<http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net>	PERSON:Daniel Schober	Bruker 1mm MicroProbe	OBI_0000319
