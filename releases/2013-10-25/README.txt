This directory contains files that are candidates for a new OBI release.

At the top level are self-contained OWL files for OBI, OBI Core, and the IEDB and ISA views of OBI. The "branches" and "external" directories contain the source files used as sources. The "docs" directory contains a list of newly added terms and reports on each of the released OWL files.

This release candidate was built using revision 3883 of the new OBI build tools:

http://sourceforge.net/p/obi/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/src/tools/build/

Since the last release we have completed the OBI Core review and revised the import system to make extensive use of OntoFox.
