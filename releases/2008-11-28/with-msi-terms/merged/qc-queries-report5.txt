If you don't know what this means you can ignore it:
ABCL source code meta-point information out of sync. Make sure you have the source code
installed, then set up the logical host ABCL-SRC to point the src directory under j, e.g.:

(setf (logical-pathname-translations "abcl-src")
      (system::backq-list (system::backq-list "**;*.*"
                                              (make-pathname :directory
                                                             (append (pathname-directory "~/repos/j/src/")
                                                                     '(:wild-inferiors))
                                                             :name
                                                             :wild
                                                             :type
                                                             :wild))))
Then call (fix-abcl-src-pointers). You can do this in your .abclrc file.
