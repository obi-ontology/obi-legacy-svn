1. Assign IDs

Run AssignOBIIDs.java


I've noticed that there were terms with labels with new lines so i've corrected the lanes and run the AssignOBIIDs.java again


2. Quality Check, details see OBIrelease-qualityCheck.txt All the SPARQL queries run in Protege 3.4.7 or Twinkle.     - Run # Check curation status of all OBI terms (ignore deprecated terms) 
        Added missing 'has curation status' which are required for the release (term: contact representative role) -> add metadata incomplete
     - Run # List all OBI classes which do not have 'has curation status' property
     Fixed: added curation status on 'contact representative role'            - Run # List all OBI terms which do not have 'has curation status' property and has 'definition editor' property
     OK (NO result) 
     
     - Run # List all OBI terms which 'has curation status' property is uncurated
     OK ( No result) 
     
     - Run # Find terms with inconsistent label and editor preferred term

      Returned the following classes: 'fluorescence detection', 'comparative phenotypic assessment', 'material acquisition', 'information acquisition'
      Fixed the misspelled editor preferred term of 'fluorescence detection'
      Made the editor preferred term consistent with the editor preferred terms in the other cases.
     - Run # List OBI classes without editor preferred term property

       Results a lot ( but the will be fixed later with the java code)
     - Run # Check all classes has obsolete reason are the subclasses of obsolete
       OK
     - Run # Check all subclasses of ObsoleteClass has obsolete reason

     Ok no result
     
3. Add missing 'editor preferred term' annotation property, which is required meta-data
        - add the property and set the value as rdfs:label

Run AddEditorPreferredTerms.java



4. Generate disjoints.owl using lisp script written by Alan

Since the code is not compatible with BFO 2, use the previous release of disjoint.owl file. Will write Java code and replace it in next release


5. Create directory '2012-07-01' under obi/releases, check previous release version to copy the files needed und the directory

- created the same folder structure under the new folder 2012-07-01 under releases- From the previous folder release (2012-03-29) i've copied:     - disjoint.owl and doap.template under the branches folder     - protege-dc.owl under external     - OBIrelease-qualityCheck.txt under docs- Form the current trunk/ontology/branches i've copied : obi.owl, external-by-hand.owl external.owl and externaDerived.owl under / branches- From the current trunk/ontology/branches i've copied the file generated by AssignIDs newIDs_20120629.tab under / docs- copied the file iao-all.owl form http://information-artifact-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/releases/2012-01-05/merged/iao-all.owl under /releases/2012-07-01/merged/iao-merged- copied from 
http://bfo.googlecode.com/svn/releases/owl-ruttenberg-2010-05-25/
files under 2012-07-01/external/bfo2-alan/
Fixed the imports in order to point to local files within the release

6. Check consistency after adding disjoint axioms

- open obi.owl using Protege 4.1
- manually import disjoints.owl
- reasoning using Hermit 1.3.4
    After running  Hermit  1.3.6  (the process took approximately 180 seconds) with disjoint there was an error with the classes cytometer, flow cytometer sorter

and flow cytometer analyzer due to the disjoint between cytometer, flow cytometer sorter and flow cytometer analyzer and cytometer (now both are subclasses of cytometer)
flow cytometer analyzer disjoint from cytometer

flow cytometer sorter disjoint from cytometer

7. Merged all the files into one file (obi-merged.owl) using protege 4.2.5.
Saved the file under /2012/07/01/merged/
8. Cleaned the merged file:
     - removed the curation status and saved as obi_merged_celand.owl
     - checked the IAO terms that have <obo:IAO_0000412 rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl"/> and double checked al the metadata for      duplicates:
          - planned_process: removed duplicated editor preferred term ( kept the one with language @en); removed the <obo:IAO_0000412 rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl"/>
          - investigation: removed the <obo:IAO_0000412 rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl"/>, removed duplicate definition, removed emty alternative term
          - 'study design execution': removed the <obo:IAO_0000412 rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl"/>
          - 'study design': removed the <obo:IAO_0000412 rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl"/>
     - Saved these changes into cleaned_merged_obi.owl
     - run the reasoner on this file : no errors found
9.Run the OBO release tool.
The input file is the cleaned_merged_obi.owl
The Output dir was a local folder /local_OBI_release/
Copied the OORT generated files under /local_OBI_release/releases/2012-07-01/ under /releases/2012-07-01/oort_generated_files
Copied the obi.owl under  /releases/2012-07-01/oort_generated_files in /releases/2012-07-01/merged/ obi-merged-reasoned.owl


10. Create IEDB view 

Run ExtractAnnotProp.java with /releases/2012-07-01/merged/ obi-merged-reasoned.owl as input

- changed the IRI of the obi_IEDBview.owlto http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/obi_IEDBview.owl
