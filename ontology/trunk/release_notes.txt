OBI.owl release notes - this file relates to changes to the ontology file,
owl:versionInfo	0.4, OBI SVN Revision 19.

This OBI.owl file is the latest draft version. It was derived from the one in the step_3 folder and is refined to map redundant classes in obi to bfo classes and remove the redundant ones.

Here what was done to the file:
The file was renamed so it does not include the date in the filename.
The redundant obi:toplevel classes 'occurrent' and 'continuant' were put under the administrative '_deleted_classes'-container, retaining their structure.
When a class is mapped, the obi class is put under the administrative '_deleted_classes'-container and the 'clsdel' meta annotation is added.
When a class gets a new parent, I updated the defs accordingly to be still arestotelian.

obi:state is_a bfo:quality
obi:characteristic is_a bfo:quality
obi:time_point	maps	bfo:temporal_instant
obi:time_intervall	maps	bfo:temporal_interval
obi:boundary	maps	bfo:object_boundary (and bfo:process_boundary)
obi:spatial_region	maps	bfo:site
obi:collection_of_physical_entities	maps	bfo:object_aggregate
obi:population	is_a	bfo:object_aggregate
obi:sample_population	is_a	bfo:object_aggregate

obi:cardinal_part_of_qualitative_value
	obi:quality --> deleted, since redundant as bfo:quality? Or should we re-name?

Questions and Remarks:
Is obi:time_interval a bfo:continuant since according to the bfo def an continuant can not have temporal parts ?
obi:data_set	is_a	bfo:object_aggregate subclass ?

obi:physical_entity	--> stay were they are (decision to map to bfo:object should be discussed)
obi:immaterial_entity	--> stay were they are (decision to map to ? or the be deleted should be discussed)

The whole representation of temporal classes should be postponed or sourced out.
