release status (OBI 1.0 and the paper):
we agreed that this should be expedited.  Each branch should have completed required meta-data, ensured that definitions and other information are correct, asked for an OBI review and (if possible) for an external review.
Terms marked uncurated will not hold up the release.
There are plans to set up a system for automatic releases every 2 months.

To expedite the release, OBI folks are invited to visit https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Milestones
and then to offer to help any branch in need of help.
JF requested that (in particular) the Plan branch move their calls to Centra so that she and other non-skype-enabled users could join


Function implementation
This is a cross-branch issue that should be resolved expiditiously
DS and Frank will select an illustrative use case for implementation if at all possible by the next telecon.
This will be implemented by BP and BB.  Others with alternative implementation strategies can also use the same use case for implementation.
Stop the e-mail discussion
Can we add a link to use cases on the front page of the wiki?



Deprecation policy
Editors should follow the deprecation policy -- terms should not be deleted.
One option is to remove axioms and move the obsolete term to the Obsolete Branch 
Another option is to tag the term and keep it in the branch until a "sweeper" script is written.
AR will provide instructions for proper check-in; includes running Pellet
policy is here: http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dzprnmw_20cdv87mdw
We all swear or affirm to follow this policy


Next agenda:  
Version number or version date.
Selection of use case for instrument function.
