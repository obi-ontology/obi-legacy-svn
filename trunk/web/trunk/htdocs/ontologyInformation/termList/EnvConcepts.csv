"  Altitude"		
"  Geographic Parameters (Parameter, Value, Unit)"	"Geographical parameters mainly relate to physical characteristics of the geographic location. Examples include: altitude, depth or slope."	"eg. Ocean Depth has been used here"
"  Topography"	"Detailed description of the regional environment and topographical features, both natural and man-made"	
"Environment"	"A complex of external factors that act on an organism(s). An environment may have one or more parameters, physical or otherwise. The environment of a given organism(s) must necessarily interact with that organism (s)."	
"  Environment Type"	"The type of environment in which the organism was exposed to prior to obtaining it as a biosource. An artificial environment is one in which the MAJORITY of environmental parameters such as temperature and lighting are controlled, for example fish in an aquarium. A natural environment is one in which the MAJORITY of environmental parameters such as temperature and light are NOT controlled, for example when an organism is removed directly from the wild and assayed."	
"  Environment Parameters (Parameter, Value, Unit)"	"Use these attributes to store environmental information relating to the organism, such as climate, photoperiod. (Repeatable)"	
"  Biotic Affectors"	"Details of competitor organisms or symbiont relationships present in the environment"	
"  Relationship type"	"Relationship of the organism to another organism as defined by this particular experiment."	
"  Relationship Target (organism)"		"Defined by standard ontology (database, value, accession) or non-standard ontology (database name,version,URI, accession, accession version)"
"Phenotype"		
"  Phenotypic Characteristic"	"Phenotypic characteristics can relate to anatomical, behavioural or physiological characteristics. A phenotypic characteristic is a compound concept that should be described as an entity and a measurable parameter of that entity. "	"Examples include: Dorsal Fin Length, Hearing Sensitivity or Nesting Duration."
"  Value"		
"  Unit"		
"  Assay"	"Assay used to assess phenotype"	
"Experimental phase (pre-conditioning, conditioning)"	"The experimental phase type of an environmental biology experiment. i.e. The phase in which the organism is stabilised prior to conditioning (pre-conditioning) or the phase in which the experimental factors are modified (conditioning)."
