OBO Foundry Associate Editor. Represent OBI in OBO Foundry. Make sure we are orthogonal to other OBO Foundry ontologies and following OBO FOundry principles. Also elect OBO FOundry Coordinating members. Alan and Richard may be OBO coordinating members - not official. Danile, Melanie, and Jennifer have volunteered. They will review the OBO FOundry principles doc and send email to the list explaining their interest and qualifications so that we can choose at the next call.

OBI coordinators. A vote will be put up to establish a core coordinating committee that will include coordinators who are active as editors and core developers. 

OBI advisors. Need to provide specific requests - more like to have these as OBI is released. Also need a more formal structure. 

Documentation of methodology. All agree that this needs to be an open process but unclear how best to achieve this. Melanie will send an email laying out options for further discussion.

Authorship on big OBI paper - postponed to next call.
