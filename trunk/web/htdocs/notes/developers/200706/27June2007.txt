OBI Developer's Call Notes: 27 June 2007
----------------------------------------

Present: Ally, Daniel, Jen, Helen, James, Ryan, Trish, Philippe, Kevin, Liju, Bill

+ PA branch does not have a report, so we will have to postpone to another day.
  + Send a response to Alan about rescheduling: alan sent email that he would send a doc via email and field questions via email if there was no one that volunteered to do the PA update
+ Instead, we'll just talk about Plan and Relations

Plan Branch Update by Philippe

+ 7 calls since last workshop
+ http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~malone/OBI/plan_branch/Plan%20Branch-report-June%2007.doc
+ Difficult to find boundary between P and PA, so we have postponed this discussion until the workshop
+ OBI Design Terms: ~60 terms (between study and study design)
+ OBI From Plan to Role: ~12
+ OBI From Plan to Biomaterial: ~3
+ OBI From Plan to Protocol Application: ~250 a majority of which are related to Protocol
+ Have started thinking about use-cases
+ Probably won't be able to provide anything in OWL for the meeting, as there is still so much to be resolved between P and PA.
+ Should we design some example use-cases specifically for the workshop, so we can sit down and go through them in the workshop?
+ Even though working independently, have still found P & PA branch terms that were "common" to both

Relation Branch Update by Liju
+ Not very many people, usually between 2-4 people. Will have two more calls before the workshop.
+ See the branch update here: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~malone/OBI/relations_branch/Relations%20Branch-report-June%2026.doc
+ The new relations presented have not been promoted to the Relations Ontology, and most probably won't be. There is now a Relations.owl file
  + Could make sub-relations of real RO relations, though
+ We need use cases and natural language definitions of relations from branches, including domains and ranges
+ Function branch needs term inputs, and no-one seems to be doing that yet

Role Branch Update by Jen
+ We have lots of terms, but most without definitions.
+ definition must have: 1) bearer 2) definition of role 3) process by which role is realized
+ first-draft of all definitions, and probably have about 200 terms placed in a hierarchy

Digital Entity.... Update by Jen
+ Starting out with a basic structure, and binning a few terms
+ should have a brief report by the workshop

Action Items:
+ Ask Alan to submit a PA branch update to the OBI Devel list
+ Jen email Gilberto: suggests that, early in the workshop agenda, we discuss these things like relations between role and function, P and PA.... Could happen in the time we already have for "brief" branch intros on monday, or afterwards. Jen will leave it up to Gilberto's discretion.
+ Bill: will email all workshop attendees to read the use-cases  prior to the workshop that are put up a new wiki, which should include as a start a link to the Protocol Application wiki page: https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/ProtocolApplicationUseCases
+ Allyson: email Gilberto and Chris to add an item to the agenda to discuss P vs PA in light of the PA use-cases available from the link above.
