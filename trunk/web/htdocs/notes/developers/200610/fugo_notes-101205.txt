CS:minor point of grammar, domains (flow cyt) instead of the current construct                
Discussion on the text,                  
AA TRISH TO CORRECT THIS GRAMMAR AND ADD THE ()                             

RiB joins, asked about agronomy point, replace with Crop Science incl Genomics
- agronomy     
is bvery specific to do with cropping systems, crop sci is about the biol of
the plant. I     
am involved in Rice and other crop genomics                                  AA TRISH TO REPLACE AGRONOMY WITH CROP GENOMICS

SS:we discussed the tabs to show diff cn internal and external projects, for

SS:SOFG will we have link to SF from FuGE/FuGO? Will they link to us? I want
to move the use cases from RSBI to FUGE/FUGO pages/                                                       
TW:do you want to keep the ontology uses cases on the FuGO site?                
SS:wants to share the CMAP concepts, better than the RSBI OWL file, and people think that this is the ontology which it is not. Has new concepts and Jennife and Norm need to sign off                                                                          
TW:we are working on the MO concept stuff, and so this can be circulated.    HP:we use the MO site and link to FuGO                                       TW:we are asking what are high level concepts and are using the MO as the first step.         
TW:we need access to the site for MO                                        
SS:Also imp. for the RSBI group, we don't want to lose concepts that are
needed.
TW:many things had changed since stanford and the other groups had other ideas and seemed like they were not interested in this                          
CT:when you've done this, how will you summarise this? How about a formal
report with some pretty pictures for wider dissemination                     SS:decided for RSBI using CMAP                                               HP:will do a text document     
TW:package by package - looking from microarray specific and checking defs,
looking for OM refs and looking for other criteria, and then would bring that back to the FuGO site.         
CT:but you will restructure it?                                              TW:but needs to be done in the context of FuGO               
CT:anyone that has a take on the structure if we can bring these together in a graphical way
TW:yes and that's a next step with high level structure, we are not there not, like the idea of using CMAP for that                                       CT:anyone used UML? 
TW:CMAP is preferable as then isn't taken as a model                         
CT:at the point that we are working on an ontology, protege is one way of
working             
rib:we use UML based system, find FUGO/FUGE complement useful vs concept maps vs uml, uml is better for sw engineers, we are using UML as we want integrated sw systems, but we will return to this later as we get back to ontology stuff.     
For the platform we have distilled generic patterns from domain and using
semantic description to ontology                                            
cs:we should settle on a tool, the tool is limiting, and when we share these
things is        
more effective if we are using the same tool?                 
hp:are there any options other than protege?                                 rib:right track using protege                                             
tw:FUGE gp is having issues with UML, and are thinking of moving to an
ontology               
rib:UML - all std tools are not v. interoperable, is a really big issue.                                   
TW: Next week                                                                talk about options for building the ontology, modular vs integrated         
do we need a sep monthly call yet? we can decide on this by email
SS:can look at the doc I circulated and recirculate please to find people    CS:from ontology side as well?                                                                
AA:CS TO PUT ON THE ONTOLOGY MAIL LIST
                          
AA:SS/TW TO SEND A LINK TO CMAP (CONCEPTMAP) AND ADD TO THE WEBSITE
