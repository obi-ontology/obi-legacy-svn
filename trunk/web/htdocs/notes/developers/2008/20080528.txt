*  call for volunteers for the OBI documentation:
http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dzprnmw_4hck67jdg
AI: branch outline - 3 weeks (18th June)
Each branch will provide an outline of its documentation section. It is up
to the branch to deal with practicalities (during call, via list..).
current volunteers:
PRS: biomaterial
CS: denrie
DS: instruments
(updated in the google doc - please modify as needed)
AL: will volunteer for some part
AR: review

* obi-users list http://groups.google.com/group/obi-users?hl=en
please subscribe if you wish. This list is intended as contact point for
users, e.g. use case submission.

* MIREOT - updated document at
http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dzprnmw_24cp3693dd&hl=en
Please review and comment

* use of SVN branch
We agreed that there is no issue in creating branches under SVN as needed
(for example Bjoern's branch for objective discussion). However the
creator of this branch is in charge of adding the changes (if approved) in
the trunk (by whatever method he wishes to use, merging, re writing...).
We might have a script rewriting branch files later on that could be of
help (not done yet)

* release
everybody agrees that we should go ahead and not delay furthermore the
release. All branches will be released as is as we want a quick release,
modifications/update will be included in next release. Branches which are
not up to date with their metadata will get released as is too.
MC and AR are working on that, DL asap.

* objective
There are still some uncertainties about the objective discussion. We will
use the word "goal" instead of objective. It was agreed to go ahead with
Bjoern's proposal. Once the release as been produced Bjoern will update
the trunk with his changes.
