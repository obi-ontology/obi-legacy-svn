Metadata Discussion
*Required Metadata*

- Milestone for 9 February is: Gilberto, Bill, Allyson, Liju, Daniel, Trish. Communicate polished Meta-Data 'Minimal Information' list proposal to OBO Foundry; ultimately this should go to SKOS (Barry, Michael, Suzi, Chris M)
- Alan thinks that SKOS probably won't need to be involved.
-- Trish: just have the list for Friday, but not the implementation.

- Definition
-- do we need the additional "colloquial" definition as extra points in the definition field?
--- Trish says the Aristotelian Definition (AD) should be enough.
--- Alan thinks that sometimes the AD is just too obfuscated.
--- Allyson suggested replacing the word "colloquial" with something that clarifies the meaning
--- Chris: suggested changing the last sentence to "Can be augmented with informal definitions to further explain the meaning of the term."
--- Alan: mentioned the difference between informative vs normative.
-- Should explain "normalized" in wherever we have the documentation for what an AD is.

- Definition_editor
-- Happy to keep it as a 1,* and happy with the definition, just make it a little cleaner
-- even if multiplicity is 1,* still need a singular word i.e. editor not editors.

- Definition_citation
-- Daniel - should be _source rather than _citation. Thinks that source is clearer, as it implies that we can modify the original, literal, definition.
-- No-one remembers why was called citation
-- Will change to definition_source
-- Definition is a little unclear. Change to: "An unambiguous and traceable reference to the source of the definition. Examples: ISBN, URI plus date, MeSH Term, PUBMED ID, DOI."

- Example_of_usage
-- the term name is too narrow, and need to broaden it to subtypes, so call it "example"
-- Definition: "An actual phrase of how a term should be used. May also include other kinds of examples, such as subtypes."

*Optional Metadata*

- alternative_term
-- should we split this into things like synonym/abbreviation/acronym? It isn't always or just a synonym, and this is just a term, and doesn't need to include all possible variations of such a term.
- alternative_term_tag
-- Should it be called usage_community? Community is to narrow to encompass all sorts of groupings.
-- shouldn't change the name, as it is based on the alternative_term name and we are keeping it intentionally generic.
-- Definition changed to: "A tag to indicate sets of alternative terms. Example: toxicogenomics_community, abbreviation."
- alternative_term_citation
-- change to alternative_term_source for same reason as changed definition_source
- addition of annotation property that marks classes as "hook" classes to other ontologies.
-- Term name: external_class
-- Term definition: An annotation property that indicates external classes, including their subtrees, for a given anchor class.
- deprecation label
-- Trish says it is important to reason over OBI, so having any deprecation annot properties would be confusing. Further, within the branches we'll use whatever we want and clean up the terms at the end.
-- could leave it for now until we determine what our deprecation policy will be.
