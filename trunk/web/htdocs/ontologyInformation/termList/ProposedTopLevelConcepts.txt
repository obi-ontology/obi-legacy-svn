ProtocolDescriptor: terms describing protocols used in a functional genomics experiment.               
Protocols include the treatment of samples, the use of intrumentation, and the processing of           
data.

experiment. Data includes the images from a functional genomics experiment, the                        
quantification of those images, and the higher order analysis of the quantifications.?
