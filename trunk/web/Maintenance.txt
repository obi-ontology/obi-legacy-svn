This is a document that should NOT go onto the shell.sourceforge.net server. Its job is to tell OBI Administrators
how they must upload changes to the server for the static pages.

UPDATE: SOURCEFORGE NOW ALLOWS DIRECT SUBVERSION ACCESS TO SHELL.SOURCEFORGE.NET. 

This means that /home/groups/o/ob/obi/htdocs and /home/groups/o/ob/obi/include are now subversion directories, and
once you've made and committed a change to your local checkout, you should just be able to update the subversion
directory directly on shell.sourceforge.net. Please let me know if you have any problems.

Remember that after running "svn update" on the htdocs or the include directories on shell.sf.net you MUST run a
chmod on any new or updated files, to ensure that others in the OBI group can perform "svn update" commands after
you. One example of a suitable chmod command is "chmod -R ug+w *"
