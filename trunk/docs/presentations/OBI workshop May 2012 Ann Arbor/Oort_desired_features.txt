Desired features for OBI release

1. Assign IDs to newly added terms and list newly added terms with the IDs assign in one output file.

2. Quality checking
- No duplicate rdfs:label, definition
- rdfs:label and editor preferred label should be same
- Curation status, should no terms in the release version with ¡®uncurated¡¯ curation status
(Or given any annotation property, set what values are not allowed or what values should be)

3. Generate disjoint axioms and add to the source ontology before running Reasoner

4. Allow users to set which imported ontologies would like to merge to the source ontology when generate merged inferred file

5. Counts of classes and properties broken down by ontology

6. Add version and doap information
(See file 'MInimum Information to Annotate an OBO Foundry Ontology' shared by Melanie: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_nR3r6TROeh-LYhJNFJpUstlz4ty41MOYimoD28Kwzk/edit?pli=1)

7. Add comments to the OWL format ontology for easy to read using Text editor. For example,
<owl:disjointWith rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000988"/>
add <!-- performing a diagnosis --> as comment to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000988
