
Yongqun He: Hi Jess
Jessica Turner: Good morning!
Yongqun He: Good morning to you too!
Yongqun He: Let's wait for a few minutes
Jessica Turner: I see "Oliver" listed as being on the call--is that you?
Yongqun He: Yes. I am Oliver :-)
Jessica Turner: :)  Sorry, I'm still getting the hange of things.
Yongqun He: You are welcome!
Jessica Turner: How do I get the most recent copy of the other (nonSIG) paper?
Melanie Courtot: morning :)
Melanie Courtot: the non SIG paper is under our SVN
Melanie Courtot: let me find the link
Jessica Turner: Ok, I've used that to download OBI as it is, maybe I can poke around and see if I can find the paper. 
Helen Parkinson: morning. 
Melanie Courtot: All of them are under http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/trunk/docs/papers/
Jessica Turner: Hi Helen.
Jessica Turner: Great, thanks1
Melanie Courtot: the "main" manuscript is under http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/trunk/docs/papers/release
Melanie Courtot: (somehow that one got a strange name)
Jessica Turner: Great, I'll bookmark that. 
Jessica Turner: (I don't have a mike, have to type to communicate this morning)
Helen Parkinson: please go ahead
Melanie Courtot: use cases: vaccine protection
Melanie Courtot: (we won't use the glucose one as used in main manuscript)
Melanie Courtot: other use cases: Larisa's robot experiment + Dirk neuroscience use case
Helen Parkinson: Oliver, I think we are all in agreement, can we skip to looking at these and id what needs to be done, and who should do that?
Jessica Turner: Derek's looks pretty thorough, I thought.
Helen Parkinson: agreed, jess did you review it yet?
Jessica Turner: I looked over thep aper and what was on the wiki page
Helen Parkinson: hang on
Jessica Turner: I want to talk to Derek a bit about some of the details but in general he took it apart pretty well, I thought. 
Helen Parkinson: AI: we need to check the deadline
Jessica Turner: The wiki page says Oct 30
Helen Parkinson: waiting for word sorry
Helen Parkinson: so who will edit the text, we have nice figs uploaded
Melanie Courtot: you are right - October 30th
Melanie Courtot: just checked too
Jessica Turner: How do you want the paper organized? around two use cases in parallel or around one big one or ...?
Melanie Courtot: 
I volunteered for review
Melanie Courtot: I think the idea is to have the 3 use cases described, one after the other
Melanie Courtot: AI: remove glucose use case and text
Melanie Courtot: AI: add other figures and start working on the text
Jessica Turner: So the step is to go through what's in these figures and make sure it's all in OBI?
Melanie Courtot: next step: make sure classes are in OBI
Melanie Courtot: I agree with Helen - we won't have time to do the modeling
Melanie Courtot: (at the instance level)
Jessica Turner: Oliver are you in contact with Derek or would it be ok if I get in touch with him directly to coordinate that use case?
Melanie Courtot: AI for authors of the use case: identify missing classes in OBI
Melanie Courtot: Jessica: I would think you are the most qualified to review Dirk's use case
Melanie Courtot: I am happy with you liasing with him - I think we'll need to work in parallel
Jessica Turner: ok
Melanie Courtot: (note: several of us are away 17-25 for a meeting)
Jessica Turner: Hey Oliver! :)
Helen Parkinson: what does the deadline need to ne?
Helen Parkinson: AI: OH willask Dirk to simply the figure so that we don't need to add so many classes to obi
Jessica Turner: that sounds reasonable--next monday, list of classes used in the example
Helen Parkinson: AI: OH will remove the glucose use case from the paper and then commit it
Melanie Courtot: AI for Jessica + Dirk, Larisa + Jie, Oliver +X  = next monday, list of classes needed (with definition)
Helen Parkinson: AI: we will ask Larissa to check her use case vs OBI and prepare a list of classes to add
Helen Parkinson: OK
Jessica Turner: nope nope nope, not me
Jessica Turner: Thanks--I fear I would introduce errors since I'm new to it.
Melanie Courtot: I can try and help - but won't have much time
Melanie Courtot: I hope classes with definitions will help a lot
Jessica Turner: Yes, that makes sense--provide new class and suggested parent as well
Yongqun He: I will help Dirk. So Helen and James will help Larisa
Yongqun He: I will work on the first revision of the paper and submit to OBI SVN.
Jessica Turner: can we walk through a bit of the spike train example?
Jessica Turner: that's all I can do. :)
Melanie Courtot: investigator + role are ok (typo in process:planning
Jessica Turner: Is that the level of classes for describing the experiment that you want?
Helen Parkinson: AI: prepare subject, present stimulus, make saccade need adding to OBI.
Melanie Courtot: hypothesies: OBI_0000074
Helen Parkinson: Jess, we can be quite precise - we may also add new parent classes for obi
Jessica Turner: it's a visual light, in this case
Melanie Courtot: I know that Bill was trying to add stimulus a long time ago - and we never solved where it was going
Helen Parkinson: AI: measuring neuron activity
Jessica Turner: The neuron is in the caudate nucleus
Jessica Turner: The description of the experimental paradigm could take a WHILE
Jessica Turner: agreed
Jessica Turner: Oh: let me explain a bit?
Helen Parkinson: please do
Helen Parkinson: AI: add SU device to OBI with def
Jessica Turner: Ok hang ong
Melanie Courtot: IMO - some things may be problematic to add: spike train, saccade, stimulus
Helen Parkinson: I'd agree
Jessica Turner: The monkey's sitting looking at a screen; a light goes off to indicate the start of a trial; then a light flashes either to the right or the left of center and the monkey has to move his eyes to where the light was (that's the saccade)
Helen Parkinson: if Jess can explain we can make an informed decision
Helen Parkinson: AI: we need to make the use case simple enough to model in OBI
Jessica Turner: Meanwhile, there are neurons in the monkey's caudate nucleus whose firing rate changes depending on various aspects of the combination of direction and expected reward for making the saccade.
Jessica Turner: Say again?
Helen Parkinson: Jess, can you provide defs working with Dirk?
Jessica Turner: I think that's my plan.
Melanie Courtot: Jess and Dirk: specialists - could provide us with definitions and ideally suggested position
Helen Parkinson: Excellent, we may need to remove complexity later
Melanie Courtot: for example, we never decided if stimulus was a process for ex
Jessica Turner: Stimulus is a role, IMHO
Helen Parkinson: I'd suggest to model this as process now, rather than stimulus. 
Helen Parkinson: That's my guy feeling
Jessica Turner: Yes, simply put
Melanie Courtot: I think it is he output of the neuron measurement
Jessica Turner: Spike train is a bunch of measured neural responses
Jessica Turner: That's what the SU device is for
Jessica Turner: So the Process: Measuring Neural Activity would be an Assay?
Jessica Turner: yes, electrodes in the caudate nucleus
Jessica Turner: Sounds reasonable
Jessica Turner: Does a thermometer assay the temperature?
Jessica Turner: Fair enough, I think we can make that work
Helen Parkinson: AI: there's an assay here. SU device has electrodes?
Melanie Courtot: I would say body as input, thermometer as device, then temperature measured as output
Jessica Turner: Ok: here's neuron as input, 
Jessica Turner: SU device + electrode as device, spike train as output
Helen Parkinson: yes that's better. so monkey as input, electrode device,  spike train out
Melanie Courtot: +1 HP and JT
Jessica Turner: I'm working on the Cognitive Paradigm Ontology and Stimulus is oneo f those things we are wrestling with...
Helen Parkinson: I think we are there with the design, we need some detail for the classes
Jessica Turner: Can we have a pointer in the discussion that the experimental protocol would require more development in the ontology?
Jessica Turner: I have to think more about what the variables are and how to best describe this in this paradigme
Jessica Turner: Stimulus = light flash in this case
Helen Parkinson: AI: we will remove the stimulus part - this is light in this case and concentrate on process.
Helen Parkinson: the spike train is a sort of data set, we can model that
Helen Parkinson: Data transformation - we might need some specific terms for this.
Jessica Turner: Dirk did a nice job down below of describing the "left cue" stimulus
Jessica Turner: keep going--one more picture below
Jessica Turner: Yes, up to a point--primarily you need to know the relationship between
Jessica Turner: stimulus location and cell firing rate
Helen Parkinson: there's a lot of detail here, how much to keep?
Yongqun He: We need to simplify it
Yongqun He: Can we use NCBI taxon monkey to represent the monkey
Jessica Turner: Terms like caudate exist in other ontologies
Jessica Turner: can we point to that in the discussion?
Helen Parkinson: the proposal would be to import these
Helen Parkinson: jess these are in nifstd no?
Jessica Turner: yes I should think so
Helen Parkinson: can you find us the ids?
Jessica Turner: Yes
Melanie Courtot: need to know: where to put them in OBI, ID and source ontology
Jessica Turner: I can talk to Dirk and come up witha  list of classes in OBI, classes needed for this use case, and classes that exist in other ontologies
Melanie Courtot: that would be perfect
Yongqun He: This is good material for discussion
Jessica Turner: that's reasonable.
Jessica Turner: NIF and FMA are trying to work together anyway
Helen Parkinson: we can go with NIFSTD then
Helen Parkinson: great
Helen Parkinson: AI: mention in text the import strategy
Melanie Courtot: ideally we would - but it takes a lot of time
Yongqun He: +1!
Jessica Turner: sounds good
Helen Parkinson: Discussion on whether we need an owl file for the use case - we decided to add only base classses to OBI and not to model individuals.
Helen Parkinson: we will report that to the list, to make sure everyones ok.
Helen Parkinson: AI: OH will remodel Dirks use case and send out.
Helen Parkinson: AI: we will model the process and not the stimulus
Jessica Turner: Ok
Helen Parkinson: AI: OH will do the classes for the vaccine case
Helen Parkinson: AI: LSS will be asked for the robot scientist and HP will speak to Jie and ask her to help, she's here in Phoenix
Helen Parkinson: agreed.
Yongqun He: OK
Melanie Courtot: we all agreed that vaccine and vaccination would be mireoted from VO into OBI
Melanie Courtot: AI for OH to add this to his list of things to mireot
Melanie Courtot: so that MC doesn't forget :)
Helen Parkinson: AI: hypothesis spec as plate layout - we need to clafiy this
Jessica Turner: the relationship between hypothesis and experimental design could be "is specified by"?
Helen Parkinson: Hypothesis is in OBI.
Jessica Turner: plate layout is the variable int he eexperiment
Helen Parkinson: there's an assay here too.
Helen Parkinson: plate into scanner, metabolite data out?
Melanie Courtot: in OBI: hypothesis is a generically dependent continuant. Those are concretized as realizable entities, which are then realized in a process
Helen Parkinson: then we can do this, this is fine. 
Helen Parkinson: plate layouts, data about the plate no?
Jessica Turner: I think I agree--the hypothesis leads to the whole process not just the plate design
Helen Parkinson: investigator role needs to inhere in a device, needs an extension to obi
Helen Parkinson: I'd be inclined to merge the first two figs into a simpler one
Melanie Courtot: you are right: inheres in organization or homo sapiens
jennifer fostel: sorry!  totally forgot this call!
Melanie Courtot: should be updated so that investigator role can inhere in device
Melanie Courtot: to cover the case for larisa, robot
Yongqun He: Thanks Bye
Jessica Turner: bye!
Jessica Turner: Hi Jenn--you missed some good discussions. :)
Jessica Turner: I'm emailing Dirk and will cc you Oliver
Melanie Courtot: AI: Oliver will se
