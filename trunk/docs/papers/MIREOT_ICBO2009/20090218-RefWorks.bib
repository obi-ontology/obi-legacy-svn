The International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project},	journal={The New England journal of medicine},	volume={329},	number={14},	pages={987-994},	abstract={BACKGROUND. Although many patients with intermediate-grade or high-grade (aggressive) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are cured by combination chemotherapy, the remainder are not cured and ultimately die of their disease. The Ann Arbor classification, used to determine the stage of this disease, does not consistently distinguish between patients with different long-term prognoses. This project was undertaken to develop a model for predicting outcome in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on the basis of the patients' clinical characteristics before treatment. METHODS. Adults with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from 16 institutions and cooperative groups in the United States, Europe, and Canada who were treated between 1982 and 1987 with combination-chemotherapy regimens containing doxorubicin were evaluated for clinical features predictive of overall survival and relapse-free survival. Features that remained independently significant in step-down regression analyses of survival were incorporated into models that identified groups of patients of all ages and groups of patients no more than 60 years old with different risks of death. RESULTS. In 2031 patients of all ages, our model, based on age, tumor stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, performance status, and number of extranodal disease sites, identified four risk groups with predicted five-year survival rates of 73 percent, 51 percent, 43 percent, and 26 percent. In 1274 patients 60 or younger, an age-adjusted model based on tumor stage, lactate dehydrogenase level, and performance status identified four risk groups with predicted five-year survival rates of 83 percent, 69 percent, 46 percent, and 32 percent. In both models, the increased risk of death was due to both a lower rate of complete responses and a higher rate of relapse from complete response. These two indexes, called the international index and the age-adjusted international index, were significantly more accurate than the Ann Arbor classification in predicting long-term survival. CONCLUSIONS. The international index and the age-adjusted international index should be used in the design of future therapeutic trials in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in the selection of appropriate therapeutic approaches for individual patients.},	keywords={Age Factors; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/drug therapy/mortality; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Regression Analysis; Risk; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome},	isbn={0028-4793},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:37,	year={1990},	title={Data file standard for flow cytometry.

Clinical prognostic models can define a population at high risk for relapse following empiric chemotherapy, although such models do not account for underlying biologic differences among tumors. Commonly observed genetic abnormalities that likely contribute to pathogenesis include translocations of BCL6, BCL2, cMYC, and FAS(CD95) mutations, and aberrant somatic hypermutation. Despite recent advances in empiric chemotherapy, including interval reduction of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and the incorporation of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, a significant proportion of patients still die of their disease. Gene expression profiling has shed light on the molecular heterogeneity within DLBCL by highlighting similarities between subsets of tumors and normal B cells, identifying features associated with unfavorable responses to empiric combination chemotherapy, and defining robust subtypes with comprehensive transcriptional signatures. Such strategies have suggested distinct routes to lymphomagenesis and have identified promising rational therapeutic targets. Additional novel therapies under investigation include those targeting BCL6 and BCL2, as well as development of novel monoclonal antibody-based therapies. Our increasing molecular understanding of the heterogeneous subsets within DLBCL will likely improve the current empiric therapy of DLBCL by identifying rational therapeutic targets in specific disease subtypes.},	keywords={Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/therapeutic use; Chromosome Aberrations; Drug Delivery Systems/methods; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/genetics},	isbn={0006-4971},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:40,	author={F.

However, analysis of the resulting data is often inefficient or does not reflect the complexity of natural communities. Because bacterioplankton assemblages frequently fall into several clusters with respect to their cellular properties, these subgroups seem to be a promising level of abstraction. Image analysis was used to detect clusters from flow cytometry data. The method was tested on a bacterial community under heavy protozoan grazing pressure. METHODS: A bivariate histogram of flow cytometry data was transformed into a gray-scale image for image analysis. After low-pass filtration, regional maxima were delimited by a watershed algorithm. The resulting areas were then used as gates on the original measurements. RESULTS: Three clusters could be detected from the bacterial assemblage. Protozoan grazing had a strong impact on the bacterial community, which could be analyzed in detail at the level of individual subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation at the level of bacterial subgroups allowed a more detailed analysis than whole-community statistics and delivered essential and ecologically meaningful information.

Central to the quest to elucidate and characterise the genes and gene products encoded within genomes are pivotal concepts concerning the processes of evolution, the mechanisms of protein folding, and, crucially, the manifestation of protein function. Our use of computers to model such concepts is limited by, and must be placed in the context of, the current limits of our understanding of these biological processes. It is important to recognise that we do not have a common understanding of what constitutes a gene; we cannot invariably say that a particular sequence or fold has arisen via divergence or convergence; we do not fully understand the rules of protein folding, so we cannot predict protein structure; and we cannot invariably diagnose protein function, given knowledge only of its sequence or structure in isolation. Accepting what we cannot do with computers plays an essential role in forming an appreciation of what we can do. Without this understanding, it is easy to be misled, as spurious arguments are often used to promote over-enthusiastic notions of what particular programs can achieve. There are valuable lessons to be learned here from the field of artificial intelligence, principal among which is the realisation that capturing and representing complex knowledge is time consuming, expensive and hard.

Flow FISH analysis can be performed using commercially available flow cytometers, and has the unique advantage over other methods for measuring telomere length of providing multi-parameter information on the length of telomere repeats in thousands of individual cells. The accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements is augmented by the automation of most pipetting (aspiration and dispensing) steps, and by including an internal standard (control cells) with a known telomere length in every tube.

One test that is commonly used for this purpose in the univariate case is the chi-squared test. Comparing multivariate distributions is qualitatively harder, as the "curse of dimensionality" means that the number of bins can grow exponentially. For the chi-squared test to be useful, data-dependent binning methods must be employed. An example of how this can be done is provided by the "probability binning" method of Roederer et al. (1,2,3). METHODS: We derive the theoretical distribution of the probability binning statistic, giving it a more rigorous foundation. We show that the null distribution is a scaled chi-square, and show how it can be related to the standard chi-squared statistic. RESULTS: A small simulation shows how the theoretical results can be used to (a) modify the probability binning statistic to make it more sensitive and (b) suggest variant statistics which, while still exploiting the data-dependent strengths of the probability binning procedure, may be easier to work with. CONCLUSIONS: The probability binning procedure effectively uses adaptive binning to locate structure in high-dimensional data. The derivation of a theoretical basis provides a more detailed interpretation of its behavior and renders the probability binning method more flexible.},	keywords={Chi-Square Distribution; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Mathematics; Multivariate Analysis; Probability},	isbn={0196-4763},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:211,	author={C.

The log transform implemented in hardware as a log amplifier or in software normalizes signals or channels so that these populations appear as clearly discernible peaks. With the advent of multiple fluorescence cytometry, spectral crossover compensation of these signals has been necessary to properly interpret the data. Unfortunately, because compensation is a subtractive process, it can produce negative and zero valued data. The log transform is undefined for these values and, as a result, forces computer algorithms to truncate these values, creating a few problems for cytometrists. Data truncation biases displays making properly compensated data appear undercompensated; thus, enticing many operators to overcompensate their data. Also, events truncated into the first histogram channel are not normally visible with typical two-dimensional graphic displays, thus hiding a large number of events and obscuring the true proportionality of negative distributions. In addition, the log transform creates unequal binning that can dramatically distort negative population distributions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The HyperLog transform is a log-like transform that admits negative, zero, and positive values. The transform is a hybrid type of transform specifically designed for compensated data. One of its parameters allows it to smoothly transition from a logarithmic to linear type of transform that is ideal for compensated data. CONCLUSIONS: The HyperLog transform is easily implemented in computer systems and results in display systems that present compensated data in an unbiased manner.},	keywords={Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Flow Cytometry/methods; Mathematics; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Software},	isbn={1552-4922 (Print)},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:43,	author={C.

In addition, SMD functions as a resource for the entire biological research community by providing unrestricted access to microarray data published by SMD users and by disseminating its source code. In addition to storing GenePix (Axon Instruments) and ScanAlyze output from spotted microarrays, SMD has recently added the ability to store, retrieve, display and analyze the complete raw data produced by several additional microarray platforms and image analysis software packages, so that we can also now accept data from Affymetrix GeneChips (MAS5/GCOS or dChip), Agilent Catalog or Custom arrays (using Agilent's Feature Extraction software) or data created by SpotReader (Niles Scientific). We have implemented software that allows us to accept MAGE-ML documents from array manufacturers and to submit MIAME-compliant data in MAGE-ML format directly to ArrayExpress and GEO, greatly increasing the ease with which data from SMD can be published adhering to accepted standards and also increasing the accessibility of published microarray data to the general public. We have introduced a new tool to facilitate data sharing among our users, so that datasets can be shared during, before or after the completion of data analysis. The latest version of the source code for the complete database package was released in November 2004 (http://smd.stanford.edu/download/), allowing researchers around the world to deploy their own installations of SMD.},	keywords={California; Database Management Systems; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Systems Integration},	isbn={1362-4962},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:45,	author={C.

Disease development is primarily determined by as yet unknown genetic factors, leading to the accumulation of activated T lymphocytes in the skin. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the nature of these T cells. METHODS: T-cell lines could be established from AD skin biopsies, but not from normal skin or AD peripheral blood, when placed in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% human AB serum, antibiotics, and the T-lymphocyte growth factors interleukins 2 and 4. The cell lines were subjected to phenotypic analysis using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and compared with lymphocytes from AD and normal control peripheral blood. RESULTS: T-cell lines from 22 of 24 consecutive skin biopsies taken from 24 adult patients with AD were established. All cells were T lymphocytes expressing several activation markers. A significant proportion of the lymphocytes had stable expression of a CD4+ CD8+ phenotype (26% +/- 6%; mean +/- SEM). Such double-positive T lymphocytes are normally only seen in the thymus and not in the peripheral immune system. CD4+ CD8+ cells in peripheral blood of the patients (12.5% +/- 3.3%) were also detected. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that a basic pathophysiological change in AD may be a faulty maturation of the T-lymphocyte system, leading to skin inflammation with CD4+ CD8+ T lymphocytes resembling immature T cells. This is likely to lead to skewing of many immune reactions in the patients.},	keywords={Adolescent; Adult; Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology; Cell Division/immunology; Cell Line; Cell Size; Dermatitis, Atopic/enzymology/immunology; Female; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Immunophenotyping; Lymphocyte Activation/immunology; Male; Middle Aged; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Skin/enzymology/immunology; Telomerase/metabolism; Telomere/ultrastructure},	isbn={0007-0963 (Print)},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1,	author={Z.

As increasing amounts of high-throughput biological data become available, a major challenge in genomic and computational biology is to develop methods for comparing data from different experimental sources. Time-series whole-genome expression data are a particularly valuable source of information because they can describe an unfolding biological process such as the cell cycle or immune response. However, comparisons of time-series expression data sets are hindered by biological and experimental inconsistencies such as differences in sampling rate, variations in the timing of biological processes, and the lack of repeats. Our algorithm overcomes these difficulties by using a continuous representation for time-series data and combining a noise model for individual samples with a global difference measure. We introduce a corresponding statistical method for computing the significance of this differential expression measure. We used our algorithm to compare cell-cycle-dependent gene expression in wild-type and knockout yeast strains. Our algorithm identified a set of 56 differentially expressed genes, and these results were validated by using independent protein-DNA-binding data. Unlike previous methods, our algorithm was also able to identify 22 non-cell-cycle-regulated genes as differentially expressed. This set of genes is significantly correlated in a set of independent expression experiments, suggesting additional roles for the transcription factors Fkh1 and Fkh2 in controlling cellular activity in yeast.},	keywords={Algorithms; Cell Cycle/genetics; Cell Cycle Proteins/physiology; Comparative Study; Gene Expression Profiling; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/physiology; Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Tacrolimus Binding Protein 1A/physiology; Transcription Factors/physiology; Yeasts/genetics},	isbn={0027-8424},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:10,	author={Z.

Each expression profile is modeled as a cubic spline (piecewise polynomial) that is estimated from the observed data and every time point influences the overall smooth expression curve. We constrain the spline coefficients of genes in the same class to have similar expression patterns, while also allowing for gene specific parameters. We show that unobserved time points can be reconstructed using our method with 10-15% less error when compared to previous best methods. Our clustering algorithm operates directly on the continuous representations of gene expression profiles, and we demonstrate that this is particularly effective when applied to nonuniformly sampled data. Our continuous alignment algorithm also avoids difficulties encountered by discrete approaches. In particular, our method allows for control of the number of degrees of freedom of the warp through the specification of parameterized functions, which helps to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate that our algorithm produces stable low-error alignments on real expression data and further show a specific application to yeast knock-out data that produces biologically meaningful results.},	keywords={Algorithms; Computational Biology; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, cdc; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics; Time Factors},	isbn={1066-5277},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:181,	author={S.

The prospective application of these predefined region boundaries in 52 blood and bone marrow samples enabled identification of lymphoma cells with regard to their presence and immunophenotype, based on the correlation of markers as defined in multiple tubes.

The additional refinement that allows the sorting of individual cells based on these criteria has seen application in many fields of research. Single cells may be sorted for microscopy, for culture and for genetic analysis by way of single cell PCR (polymerase chain reaction). In practical terms, in the setting up of an instrument for single cell sorting, there are additional requirements to ensure that each detected event is indeed a single cell or body, that this cell can be reliably sorted via saline droplet, separate from its fellow travelers, that the aiming of the droplet deflection is sufficiently precise to find the target vessel and that the cell will be undamaged on arrival. Among the diverse reported applications of the technique, two fields which have benefited greatly are lymphocyte development and haemopoiesis. In the former case, the analysis of gene rearrangements in lymphocytes, both in the pre- and post-antigenic phases of development, has been enabled by the combined technologies of single cell sorting and PCR. It is argued that such experiments could not have been done without that partnership. In a similar way, the single cell sorting technique has been found to be the perfect way to demonstrate precursor/progeny relationships between haemopoietic cells and, further, to demonstrate rigorously the effects of particular cytokines on the haemopoietic system},	keywords={analysis; Cell Separation; Clone Cells; Cytokines; cytology; Flow Cytometry; Hematopoiesis; Human; Lymphocytes; methods; physiology; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Quality Control},	url={PM:10986404}}}@article{RefWorks:1338,	author={A.

We review the application of multivariate data analysis and pattern recognition techniques to flow cytometry. METHODS: Approaches were divided into two broad types depending on whether the aim was identification or clustering. Multivariate statistical approaches, supervised artificial neural networks (ANNs), problems of overlapping character distributions, unbounded data sets, missing parameters, scaling up, and estimating proportions of different types of cells comprised the first category. Classic clustering methods, fuzzy clustering, and unsupervised ANNs comprised the second category.We demonstrate the state of the art by using AFC data on marine phytoplankton populations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Information held within the large quantities of data generated by AFC was tractable using ANNs, but for field studies the problem of obtaining suitable training data needs to be resolved, and coping with an almost infinite number of cell categories needs further research},	keywords={analysis; classification; Flow Cytometry; methods; Neural Networks (Computer); Phytoplankton; Support,Non-U.S.Gov't},	url={PM:11429770}}}@article{RefWorks:1404,	author={M.

While the number of different synaptic states, characterized by distinct synaptic protein clusters, is enormous (>155,000), these states together form synaptic networks defining distinct and mutually exclusive territories in the hippocampus tissue. The findings provide insight in the systems biology of gene expression on transcriptome, proteome and toponome levels of function in the same brain subregion.

In this article, we review the current position in ontologies and how they have become institutionalized within biomedicine. As the field has matured, the much older philosophical aspects of ontology have come into play. With this and the institutionalization of ontology has come greater formality.

These data are reduced during analysis using a manual or semiautomated process of gating. Despite the need to gate data for traditional analyses, it is well recognized that analyst-to-analyst variability can impact the dataset. Moreover, cells of interest can be inadvertently excluded from the gate, and relationships between collected variables may go unappreciated because they were not included in the original analysis plan. A multivariate non-gating technique was developed and implemented that accomplished the same goal as traditional gating while eliminating many weaknesses. The procedure was validated against traditional gating for analysis of circulating B cells in normal donors (n = 20) and persons with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (n = 42). The method recapitulated relationships in the dataset while providing for an automated and objective assessment of the data. Flow cytometry analyses are amenable to automated analytical techniques that are not predicated on discrete operator-generated gates. Such alternative approaches can remove subjectivity in data analysis, improve efficiency and may ultimately enable construction of large bioinformatics data systems for more sophisticated approaches to hypothesis testing.},	keywords={Algorithms; B-Lymphocyte Subsets/classification/immunology; Case-Control Studies; Computational Biology; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Flow Cytometry/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Immunophenotyping/statistics & numerical data; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/immunology; Models, Statistical},	isbn={1552-4930},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:53,	author={M.

Conceptual data modelling involves the development of implementation-independent models that capture and make explicit the principal structural properties of data. Entities such as a biopolymer or a reaction, and their relations, eg catalyses, can be formalised using a conceptual data model. Conceptual models are implementation-independent and can be transformed in systematic ways for implementation using different platforms, eg traditional database management systems.

Because GvHD is mediated by donor T cells and other immune effector cells, we sought to determine whether changes within a wide array of peripheral blood lymphocyte populations could predict the development of GvHD. Peripheral blood samples from 31 patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant were analyzed for the proportion of 121 different subpopulations defined by 4-color combinations of lymphocyte phenotypic and activation markers at progressive time points posttransplant. Samples were processed using a newly developed high content flow cytometry technique and subjected to a spline- and functional linear discriminant analysis (FLDA)-based temporal analysis technique. This strategy identified a consistent posttransplant increase in the proportion and extent of fluctuation of CD3+CD4+CD8beta+ cells in patients who developed GVHD compared to those that did not. Although larger prospective clinical studies will be necessary to validate these results, this study demonstrates that high-content flow cytometry coupled with temporal analysis is a powerful approach for developing new diagnostic tools, and may be useful for developing a sensitive and specific predictive test for GVHD.},	keywords={Antigens, CD3; Antigens, CD4; Antigens, CD8; Flow Cytometry/methods; Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects; Immunophenotyping/methods; Lymphocyte Activation; Lymphocytes/pathology; Predictive Value of Tests; Time},	isbn={1083-8791},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:385,	author={R.

Instead of clustering, our goal was to compare all pairs of genes to determine whether there was evidence of a phase shift between them. We describe a technique where gene expression is treated as a discrete time-invariant signal, allowing the use of digital signal-processing tools, including power spectral density, coherence, and transfer gain and phase shift. We used these on a public RNA expression set of 2467 genes measured every 7 min for 119 min and found 18 putative associations. Two of these were known in the biomedical literature and may have been missed using correlation coefficients. Digital signal processing tools can be embedded and enhance existing clustering algorithms.},	keywords={Algorithms; Comparative Study; Computational Biology; DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics; Exodeoxyribonucleases/genetics; Fungal Proteins/genetics; Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data; Genes, Fungal; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics; *Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Time Factors},	url={http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=12198759}}}@article{RefWorks:407,	author={Priscilla Caplan},	year={2003},	month={October 2003},	title={Patents and Open Standards},	journal={Information Standards Quarterly},	volume={14},	number={4}}}@inproceedings{RefWorks:1491,	author={Jeremy J.

One of the major bottlenecks in developing bio-ontologies is the lack of a unified methodology. Different methodologies have been proposed for different scenarios, but there is no agreed-upon standard methodology for building ontologies. The involvement of geographically distributed domain experts, the need for domain experts to lead the design process, the application of the ontologies and the life cycles of bio-ontologies are amongst the features not considered by previously proposed methodologies. RESULTS: Here, we present a methodology for developing ontologies within the biological domain. We describe our scenario, competency questions, results and milestones for each methodological stage. We introduce the use of concept maps during knowledge acquisition phases as a feasible transition between domain expert and knowledge engineer. CONCLUSION: The contributions of this paper are the thorough description of the steps we suggest when building an ontology, example use of concept maps, consideration of applicability to the development of lower-level ontologies and application to decentralised environments. We have found that within our scenario conceptual maps played an important role in the development process.},	keywords={Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Databases, Factual; Genomics/methods; Models, Biological; Natural Language Processing; Nutrition; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Terminology},	isbn={1471-2105},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1382,	author={J.

Almost no published guidance exists for immunologists to design appropriate and useful data management systems. METHODS: We describe the design and implementation of a Microsoft Access relational database used in a clinical trial in which the primary immunogenicity measures were ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining. RESULTS: Our data management system enabled us to perform sophisticated queries and to interpret our data as quantitatively as possible. It could easily be used without modification by other researchers using automated plate reading of ELISpot plates or four color flow cytometry. CONCLUSION: We illustrate in detail the use of a flexible data management system for two of the most widely used immunological techniques. Minor modifications for more colors or other outputs can easily be implemented. Based on this example, other modifications could be easily envisaged for any other quantitative output.},	keywords={Biological Specimen Banks/organization & administration; *Clinical Trials as Topic; *Database Management Systems; Flow Cytometry/*methods; Humans; Immunoassay/*methods; Models, Immunological; Software},	isbn={1552-4949 (Print)},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1306,	author={WC Chan and JO Armitage and R.

The configuration of cells as represented by multiple markers simultaneously can be modeled arbitrarily well as a mixture of Gaussian distributions in the dimension of the number of markers. Cellular subtypes may be related to one or multiple components of such mixtures, and fitted mixture models can be evaluated in the full set of markers as an alternative, or adjunct, to traditional subjective gating methods that rely on choosing one or two dimensions. Four color flow data from human blood cells labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-CD3, PE-conjugated anti-CD8, PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD4, and APC-conjugated anti-CD19 Abs was acquired on a FACSCalibur. Cells from four murine cell lines, JAWS II, RAW 264.7, CTLL-2, and A20, were also stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD11c, PE-conjugated anti-CD11b, PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD8a, and PE-Cy7-conjugated-CD45R/B220 Abs, respectively, and single color flow data were collected on an LSRII. The data were fitted with a mixture of multivariate Gaussians using standard Bayesian statistical approaches and Markov chain Monte Carlo computations. Statistical mixture models were able to identify and purify major cell subsets in human peripheral blood, using an automated process that can be generalized to an arbitrary number of markers. Validation against both traditional expert gating and synthetic mixtures of murine cell lines with known mixing proportions was also performed. This article describes the studies of statistical mixture modeling of flow cytometric data, and demonstrates their utility in examples with four-color flow data from human peripheral blood samples and synthetic mixtures of murine cell lines.

METHODS: A review of the published literature using PubMed, as well as full-text searches of recent Medinfo and American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) Symposia proceedings, searching for the terms 'ontology' and 'ontologies' and for articles discussing specific, prominent ontological work. RESULTS: We summaries the ontologic aspects of twelve current terminology projects: Galen, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), the Medical Entities Dictionary (MED), SNOMED-CT, LOINC, the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), the Gene Ontology (GO), ISO Reference Terminology Model for Nursing Diagnosis, NDF-RT, RxNorm, the NCI Thesaurus, and DOLCE+. We discuss the origins, domain, and ontologic representation of each of these and attempt to summarize the impact that each has had on terminologic work and biomedical applications. We also note the contributions of the Protege tool to many of these efforts. CONCLUSION: Terminologic research and development have advanced significantly in the past 20 years, especially since the recent orientation toward controlled biomedical ontologies. This work has had significant impact on the development of terminologies themselves, their acceptance and dissemination as standards, and their use in supporting biomedical information systems.},	keywords={Knowledge Bases; Medical Informatics; Terminology as Topic; Vocabulary, Controlled},	isbn={0943-4747},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:226,	author={T.

This shortcoming limits our ability to integrate multiple knowledgebases, each of which gives partial information of a shared domain, as is commonly seen in bioinformatics. The Life Science Identifier (LSID) and LSID Resolution System (LSRS) provide simple and elegant solutions to this problem, based on the extension of existing internet technologies. LSID and LSRS are consistent with next-generation semantic web and semantic grid approaches. This article describes the syntax, operations, infrastructure compatibility considerations, use cases and potential future applications of LSID and LSRS.

In this study, we describe and validate a new automated method based on vector quantization algorithms to analyze multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping data in a series of 307 peripheral blood (PB) samples. Our results show that the automated method of analysis proposed compares well with currently used manual approach and significantly improves semiautomated approaches and, that by using it, a highly efficient discrimination with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity can be made between normal/reactive PB samples and cases with B-CLPD based on the total B-cell number and/or the sIgkappa+/sIglambda+ B-cell ratio. In addition, the method proved to be able to detect the presence of pathologic neoplastic B-cells even when these are present at low frequencies (<5% of all lymphocytes in the sample) and in poor-quality samples enriched in 'noise' events.},	keywords={Artifacts; Early Diagnosis; Flow Cytometry/methods/standards/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Immunophenotyping/methods/standards/statistics & numerical data; Leukemia, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis; Lymphocyte Subsets; Lymphocytosis/blood/diagnosis; Mass Screening/methods/standards/statistics & numerical data; Observer Variation; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity},	isbn={0887-6924},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1348,	author={R.

Each scientific community tends to create its own locally available ontology. The interfaces to query these ontologies tend to vary from group to group. We saw the need for a centralized location to perform controlled vocabulary queries that would offer both a lightweight web-accessible user interface as well as a consistent, unified SOAP interface for automated queries. RESULTS: The Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) was created to integrate publicly available biomedical ontologies into a single database. All modified ontologies are updated daily. A list of currently loaded ontologies is available online. The database can be queried to obtain information on a single term or to browse a complete ontology using AJAX. Auto-completion provides a user-friendly search mechanism. An AJAX-based ontology viewer is available to browse a complete ontology or subsets of it. A programmatic interface is available to query the webservice using SOAP. The service is described by a WSDL descriptor file available online. A sample Java client to connect to the webservice using SOAP is available for download from SourceForge. All OLS source code is publicly available under the open source Apache Licence.

Programmatic access to the processed data should be supported to ensure the maximum possible value is extracted. Confronted with these challenges at the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics, we decided to develop a robust infrastructure for data management and integration that supports advanced biomedical applications.

The Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR) provides a metadata registry for common data elements. Cancer Bioinformatics Infrastructure Objects (caBIO) implements an object-oriented model of the biomedical domain and provides Java, Simple Object Access Protocol and HTTP-XML application programming interfaces. caCORE has been used to develop scientific applications that bring together data from distinct genomic and clinical science sources.

Of the 27 cases with initial cytohistologic discrepancies, 12 were classified as HD and 10 were categorized as lymphocytic or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by both cytology and histology upon review. Following review, the accuracy of FNA cytology for the diagnosis of HD improved to 98.0%, with 71.4% correct subtyping. The greatest limitation of cytologic subtyping was in cases of nodular sclerotic HD: only 3 of 17 cases could be subtyped even after review. The cytomorphologic features of the HD subtypes are described, and the difficulties encountered in the cytodiagnosis of HD are discussed at length. The results of this study indicate that FNA cytology is a useful tool not only for the diagnosis of HD, but also for its subtyping.},	keywords={Adult; Aged; Biopsy, Needle/methods; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hodgkin Disease/classification/diagnosis/pathology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged},	isbn={0001-5547},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:299,	author={B.

Conventional techniques for time series analysis are not suitable for such a short series of time-ordered data. The analysis of gene expression data has therefore usually been limited to a fold-change analysis, instead of a systematic statistical approach. Methods: We use the maximum likelihood method together with Akaike's Information Criterion to fit linear splines to a small set of time-ordered gene expression data in order to infer statistically meaningful information from the measurements. The significance of measured gene expression data is assessed using Student's t-test. Results: Previous gene expression measurements of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were reanalyzed using linear splines. The temporal response was identified of many genes that had been missed by a fold-change analysis. Based on our statistical analysis, we found that about four gene expression measurements or more are needed at each time point.

In this paper, we discuss an equivalence between the objective functions used in these seemingly different methods--in particular, a general weighted kernel k-means objective is mathematically equivalent to a weighted graph clustering objective. We exploit this equivalence to develop a fast, high-quality multilevel algorithm that directly optimizes various weighted graph clustering objectives, such as the popular ratio cut, normalized cut, and ratio association criteria. This eliminates the need for any eigenvector computation for graph clustering problems, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs. Previous multilevel graph partitioning methods, such as Metis, have suffered from the restriction of equal-sized clusters; our multilevel algorithm removes this restriction by using kernel k-means to optimize weighted graph cuts. Experimental results show that our multilevel algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithm in terms of speed, memory usage, and quality. We demonstrate that our algorithm is applicable to large-scale clustering tasks such as image segmentation, social network analysis and gene network analysis.},	keywords={Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Image Enhancement/methods; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods; Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity},	isbn={0162-8828},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1460,	author={L.

The number of physicians with special training in the interpretation of these studies is limited. A knowledge-based computer system has been designed to aid in the interpretation of immunophenotyping and DNA flow cytometry results in hematopoietic disease. The system, known as "Professor Fidelio," is a heuristic classification system that reasons on the basis of defined diagnostic patterns. In this study, Fidelio was tested as a stand-alone system on 366 specimens from two large tertiary medical centers. Fidelio's interpretation was considered to be appropriate in all cases. In 300 of 366 (82%) specimens, the system's interpretation agreed with the diagnosis of record. Many of the disagreements could be traced to errors in the recording of the original diagnosis and minor differences in diagnostic criteria between Fidelio's knowledge base and the criteria in use at the medical centers. When used in a stand-alone mode, Fidelio's interpretation was less specific than the diagnosis of record in certain lymphoproliferative disorders that require morphologic information for subclassification. Professor Fidelio is one module in a workstation for the diagnostic hematology laboratory. This workstation is designed for interpretive reporting, education, and database functions for clinical research. Clinical and morphologic information are shared between Fidelio and the other modules for peripheral blood analysis, bone marrow morphology, and lymph node interpretation by means of a relational database. The system will be useful in hospitals that lack individuals specially trained in flow cytometry.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},	keywords={Artificial Intelligence; Cell Division; DNA/analysis; Diagnosis, Differential; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Immunophenotyping/methods; Leukemia/diagnosis/pathology; Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology; Male; Ploidies; Software},	isbn={0196-4763},	language={eng}}}@book{RefWorks:26,	author={P.

The method involves preparation of aqueous suspensions of intact nuclei whose DNA is stained using a DNA fluorochrome. The nuclei are classified according to their relative fluorescence intensity or DNA content. Because the sample preparation and analysis is convenient and rapid, DNA flow cytometry has become a popular method for ploidy screening, detection of mixoploidy and aneuploidy, cell cycle analysis, assessment of the degree of polysomaty, determination of reproductive pathway, and estimation of absolute DNA amount or genome size. While the former applications are relatively straightforward, estimation of absolute DNA amount requires special attention to possible errors in sample preparation and analysis. SCOPE: The article reviews current procedures for estimation of absolute DNA amounts in plants using flow cytometry, with special emphasis on preparation of nuclei suspensions, stoichiometric DNA staining and the use of DNA reference standards. In addition, methodological pitfalls encountered in estimation of intraspecific variation in genome size are discussed as well as problems linked to the use of DNA flow cytometry for fieldwork. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable estimation of absolute DNA amounts in plants using flow cytometry is not a trivial task. Although several well-proven protocols are available and some factors controlling the precision and reproducibility have been identified, several problems persist: (1) the need for fresh tissues complicates the transfer of samples from field to the laboratory and/or their storage; (2) the role of cytosolic compounds interfering with quantitative DNA staining is not well understood; and (3) the use of a set of internationally agreed DNA reference standards still remains an unrealized goal.},	keywords={Cell Nucleus/genetics; DNA, Plant/genetics; Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/methods/trends; Genome, Plant; Plants/genetics; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Variation (Genetics)},	isbn={0305-7364},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:297,	author={H.

We reviewed 139 consecutive FNABS of 84 primary and 55 recurrent lymphomas. FCM was successful in 105 (75%) cases. The overall results, including cases without FCM, included 93/139 (67%) true positive, 7 (5%) false negative, and 39 indeterminate (27 [19%] suspicious and 12 [9%] atypical) diagnoses of lymphoma. In cases with FCM, there were 80/105 (77%) true positive, no false negative, and 25 indeterminate diagnoses (15 [14%] suspicious and 10 [9%] atypical). The overall results of the 84 primary lymphomas were 55 (67%) true positive, 5 (5%) false negative, and 24 indeterminate (14[16%] suspicious and 10 [12%] atypical) diagnoses for lymphoma. Of the 68 primary lymphomas analyzed with FCM, 50 [74%] were true positives, and 28 were indeterminate (11 [16%] suspicious and 7 [10%] atypical). There were no false negatives. Diagnostic accuracy varied among lymphoma subtypes. Subclassification of the positive cases were initially conclusive in only 55/93 cases (59%). However, a retrospective review of the morphologic together with FCM data in 15 of the 23 unclassified cases improved the overall subclassification of positive cases to 77%. Subclassification was best in small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and plasmacytoma (all 100%). Subclassification was poor in marginal-zone lymphoma (33%), and initially as well in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (62%), but it improved on review (95%), as did subclassification of follicular lymphoma (77 to 100% on review). Hodgkin's disease was recognized as malignant in only 44% of the cases (7/16) and was classified as such based on morphology alone. This review of our early efforts to diagnose and subclassify lymphoma with FNAB and FCM indicates that although a diagnosis and proper subclassification of lymphoma can be made with certainty in the majority of cases, recurrent or primary, it requires close coordination of cytomorphology and immunophenotyping data, which often comes with close cooperation of cytopathologists and hematopathologists. A mere cytological diagnosis of positive for lymphoma is no longer acceptable if FNAB is to become an independent diagnostic tool for lymphoma.},	keywords={Biopsy, Needle; False Negative Reactions; False Positive Reactions; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Image Cytometry; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies},	isbn={0893-3952},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1455,	author={M.

Data on birth weight, gestational age at delivery, length of labor, presence of stained amniotic fluid, medications used during labor, maternal risk factors, age and parity were collected. RESULTS: The percentage of T lymphocytes decreased while the percentage of NK lymphocytes increased with decreasing pH over the whole range of pH values. The proportions of T and NK lymphocytes were associated with the administration of neuroplegics, spasmolytics or dihydroergotoxin in the first stage of labor.

We describe a data model in the domain of flow cytometry (FC) allowing for massive management, analysis and integration with other laboratory and clinical information. The paper is concerned with the proper translation of the Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) into a relational database schema, in a way that facilitates end users at either doing research on FC or studying specific cases of patients undergone FC analysis RESULTS: The proposed database schema provides integration of data originating from diverse acquisition settings, organized in a way that allows syntactically simple queries that provide results significantly faster than the conventional implementations of the FCS standard. The proposed schema can potentially achieve up to 8 orders of magnitude reduction in query complexity and up to 2 orders of magnitude reduction in response time for data originating from flow cytometers that record 256 colours. This is mainly achieved by managing to maintain an almost constant number of data-mining procedures regardless of the size and complexity of the stored information. CONCLUSION: It is evident that using single-file data storage standards for the design of databases without any structural transformations significantly limits the flexibility of databases. Analysis of the requirements of a specific domain for integration and massive data processing can provide the necessary schema modifications that will unlock the additional functionality of a relational database.},	keywords={*Algorithms; *Database Management Systems; *Databases, Factual; Flow Cytometry/*methods; Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods; *Software; Systems Integration; *User-Computer Interface},	isbn={1471-2105 (Electronic)},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:208,	author={M.

Select cases may require additional ancillary cytogenetic and molecular studies for diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to focus on the applications of flow cytometric and immunohistochemical immunophenotyping of paraffin-embedded tissue to diagnostic hematopathology. Advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are examined. DATA SOURCES: The literature is extensively reviewed (PubMed 1985-2003) with an emphasis on the most recent applications and those that are most useful clinically, both diagnostically and prognostically.Study Selection.-Studies were selected based on statistically significant results in large studies with reported adequate clinical follow-up. DATA EXTRACTION: The methodology was reviewed in the selected studies to ensure reliable comparison of reported data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Flow cytometric immunophenotyping offers the sensitive detection of antigens for which antibodies may not be available for paraffin immunohistochemical immunophenotyping. However, paraffin immunohistochemical immunophenotyping offers preservation of architecture and evaluation of expression of some proteins, which may not be available by flow cytometric immunophenotyping. These techniques should be used as complimentary tools in diagnostic hematopathology. CONCLUSIONS: There are extensive applications of flow cytometric and immunohistochemical immunophenotyping to diagnostic hematopathology. As cytogenetic and molecular findings evolve in diagnostic hematopathology, there may be additional applications of flow cytometric and immunohistochemical immunophenotyping to this field of pathology.},	keywords={Flow Cytometry; Hematologic Diseases/pathology; Hematology/methods; Immunohistochemistry; Immunophenotyping/methods; Leukemia/pathology; Lymphoma/pathology},	isbn={1543-2165},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:384,	author={B.

This article summarizes available evidence and current primary publications for debate. RECENT FINDINGS: Work completed during the review period has reinforced current understanding of perinatal infection, prematurity and brain injury. In animal experiments: lipopolysaccharides have been further implicated in brain injury, not only as a cause of brain injury but also as mediators of preconditioning and protection. Recent studies suggest that cerebral injury following low-dose lipopolysaccharide administration may become compensated in adulthood. Other studies have emphasized the complexity of the response by showing that plasma cytokine levels may not reflect those in the central nervous system or inflammatory events in the brain. SUMMARY: Perinatal infection and maternofetal inflammation is strongly associated with preterm birth.

Two decades ago, the International Working Formulation enabled diagnosis and management on the basis of H&E sections alone, with no mandatory requirement for immunophenotyping, molecular studies or any other ancillary investigations. The concept of categorisation by 'clinicopathological entities' defined by clinical features, morphology, immunophenotype and more recently, genotype, began with the Kiel, and Lukes and Collins classifications in the late 1970s, becoming fully expressed in the REAL and subsequently WHO classifications. The current, multidisciplinary approach to categorisation adds significantly to the task facing the anatomical pathologist, since it requires distribution of biopsy material to all the appropriate specialised laboratories, the gathering of a range of cross-disciplinary information, the correlation of all diagnostic findings, deduction of a definitive diagnosis and, finally, integration of all the above into a single multiparameter report. In this review, we summarise the contemporary approach to the biopsy, diagnosis and reporting of lymphoproliferative disorders.},	keywords={Decision Trees; Female; Humans; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/pathology; Male; Pathology, Clinical/methods; World Health Organization},	isbn={0031-3025},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1414,	author={L.

Information is also retrieved from GEO, OMIM, and major genome sequence browsers. ENCODEdb Consortium Data searches allow users to perform compound queries on array-based ENCODE data available both from GEO and from the UCSC Genome Browser.

More than 80% of all time series expression datasets are short (8 time points or fewer). These datasets present unique challenges. On account of the large number of genes profiled (often tens of thousands) and the small number of time points many patterns are expected to arise at random. Most clustering algorithms are unable to distinguish between real and random patterns. RESULTS: We present an algorithm specifically designed for clustering short time series expression data. Our algorithm works by assigning genes to a predefined set of model profiles that capture the potential distinct patterns that can be expected from the experiment. We discuss how to obtain such a set of profiles and how to determine the significance of each of these profiles. Significant profiles are retained for further analysis and can be combined to form clusters. We tested our method on both simulated and real biological data. Using immune response data we show that our algorithm can correctly detect the temporal profile of relevant functional categories. Using Gene Ontology analysis we show that our algorithm outperforms both general clustering algorithms and algorithms designed specifically for clustering time series gene expression data.

Although urea has been shown to  contribute as much as 50% of the nitrogen for phytoplankton nutrition,  relatively little is known of the activity and expression of urease in  phytoplankton. Using an in vitro enzyme assay, urease activities were  examined in laboratory cultures of three species: Aureococcus anophagefferens Hargraves et Sieburth,           Prorocentrum minimum (Pavillard) Schiller, and Thalassiosira weissflogii (Grunow) Fryxell et Hasle.   Cultures of P. minimum and T. weissflogii were grown on three nitrogen sources  (NO3-, NH4+, and urea), while           A. anophagefferens was grown   only on NO3-  and urea. Urease was found to be constitutive in all cultures, but  activity varied with growth rate and assay temperature for the  different cultures. For A. anophagefferens, urease activity varied positively with growth rate regardless of the N source, while for           P. minimum,   urease activity varied positively with growth rate only for cultures grown on urea and  NH4+. In contrast, for           T. weissflogii,  activity did not vary with growth rate for any of the N sources. For  all species, urease activity increased with assay temperature, but with  different apparent temperature optima. For A. anophagefferens, in vitro activity increased from near 030C, and remained stable to 50C, while for           P. minimum,   increased in vitro activity was noted from near 020C, but constant activity was observed between 20C and 50C. For           T. weissfloggii,  while activity also increased from 0C to 20C, subsequent decreases  were noted when temperature was elevated above 20C. Urease activity  had a half saturation constant of 120165 g atom N l-1 in all three species. On both an hourly and daily basis, urease activity in           A. anophagefferens exceeded nitrogen   demand for growth. In P. minimum, urease activity on an hourly basis matched the nitrogen demand, but was less than the demand on a daily basis.   For T. weissflogii,  urease activity was always less than the nitrogen demand. These  patterns in urease activity in three different species demonstrate that  while apparently constitutive, the regulation of activity was  substantially different in the diatom. These differences in the  physiological regulation of urease activity, as well as other enzymes,  may play a role in their ecological success in different environments.}}}@article{RefWorks:1408,	author={P.

Further progress in the management of ALL is currently limited, however, by our incomplete understanding of the molecular pathways involved in leukemia pathogenesis and by the lack of useful prognostic markers for most patients. The recent development of microarray technology, which allows the simultaneous analysis of gene expression levels for thousands of transcripts, has accelerated significantly the rate of progress in our understanding of the molecular basis of ALL. During the last few years, analysis of ALL samples with DNA arrays has facilitated the recognition of molecularly distinct leukemia groups, advanced our knowledge of the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy, generated novel prognostic prediction tools, and identified new targets for the development of molecularly tailored antileukemic agents. Thus, the introduction of microarray gene expression profiling has opened the opportunity for accelerated progress in the diagnosis and therapy of ALL, which will ultimately result in the development of novel highly effective and less toxic treatments for this disease.},	keywords={Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics; Humans; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/pathology; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Prognosis; Tumor Markers, Biological/genetics},	isbn={0925-5710},	language={eng}}}@misc{RefWorks:312,	author={FICCS},	year={2007},	title={Flow Informatics and Computational Cytometry Society.},	volume={2007},	number={7/31}}}@article{RefWorks:193,	author={D.

In murine models, macrophage secretion of interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) contributes to gut GVHD pathogenesis. To help characterize whether human gut GVHD has similar biological characteristics, monocyte IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha production were evaluated after HSCT. METHODS: Patients with refractory hematologic malignancy (n = 17) underwent reduced-intensity conditioning, HLA-matched sibling HSCT, and cyclosporine A GVHD prophylaxis. After HSCT, monocyte IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha levels were measured using intracellular flow cytometry (IC-FCM), and results were correlated with clinical GVHD. RESULTS: Incidences of acute GVHD were none (n = 3), grades I-II (n = 9), or grades III-IV (n = 5; each case with stage 2-3 gut GVHD). Posttransplantation monocyte IL-1alpha production (percentage of CD14(+)IL-1(+) cells) increased significantly from 8.7% +/- 3.7% (week 2) to 40.3% +/- 7.3% (week 4; P = 0.0065) and was not associated with GVHD severity (P = 1.00). Conversely, increases in monocyte TNF-alpha were quantitatively reduced and temporally delayed, from 0.6% +/- 0.2% (week 2) to 3.6% +/- 1.4% (week 6; P = 0.076). Most importantly, elevation of monocyte TNF-alpha level correlated with increased gut GVHD severity (P = 0.0041); increases in monocyte TNF-alpha levels typically preceded the onset of gut GVHD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Human gut GVHD after reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT is associated with monocyte cytokine secretion initially involving IL-1alpha, followed by TNF-alpha. Serial measurement of monocyte cytokines, in particular, TNF-alpha, by IC-FCM may represent a noninvasive method for GVHD monitoring, potentially allowing the identification of patients appropriate for early-intervention strategies.},	keywords={Adult; Aged; Cell Movement; Cytokines/analysis/biosynthesis; Disease Progression; Female; Flow Cytometry; Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/mortality/physiopathology; Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/therapy; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods; Humans; Interleukin-1/analysis/biosynthesis; Male; Middle Aged; Monocytes; Prospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Transplantation, Homologous; Tumor Markers, Biological/blood; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/biosynthesis},	isbn={1542-3565},	language={eng}}}@inproceedings{RefWorks:73,	author={M.

ANS "learn" to make classifications using all of the measured parameters simultaneously. Mathematical models and programming expertise are not required. ANS are inherently parallel so that high processing speed can be achieved. Because ANS are nonlinear, curved class boundaries and other nonlinearities can emerge naturally. Here, we present biomedical and oceanographic data to demonstrate the useful properties of neural networks for processing and analyzing flow cytometry data. We show that ANS are equally useful for human leukocytes and marine plankton data.

These measurements provide a "snapshot" of transcription levels within the cell. A major challenge in computational biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions and key biological features of cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes based on multiple expression measurements. This framework builds on the use of Bayesian networks for representing statistical dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint multivariate probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes and because they provide a clear methodology for learning from (noisy) observations. We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions between genes. We then describe a method for recovering gene interactions from microarray data using tools for learning Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate this method on the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle measurements of Spellman et al.

Interfaces typically support repository access by means of web pages, but other means are also used, such as desktop applications and command line tools. Interfaces often duplicate functionality amongst each other, and this implies that associated development activities are repeated in different laboratories. Interfaces developed by public laboratories are often created with limited developer resources. In such environments, reducing the time spent on creating user interfaces allows for a better deployment of resources for specialised tasks, such as data integration or analysis. Laboratories maintaining data resources are challenged to reconcile requirements for software that is reliable, functional and flexible with limitations on software development resources. RESULTS: This paper proposes a model-driven approach for the partial generation of user interfaces for searching and browsing bioinformatics data repositories. Inspired by the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) of the Object Management Group (OMG), we have developed a system that generates interfaces designed for use with bioinformatics resources. This approach helps laboratory domain experts decrease the amount of time they have to spend dealing with the repetitive aspects of user interface development. As a result, the amount of time they can spend on gathering requirements and helping develop specialised features increases. The resulting system is known as Pierre, and has been validated through its application to use cases in the life sciences, including the PEDRoDB proteomics database and the e-Fungi data warehouse. CONCLUSION: MDAs focus on generating software from models that describe aspects of service capabilities, and can be applied to support rapid development of repository interfaces in bioinformatics. The Pierre MDA is capable of supporting common database access requirements with a variety of auto-generated interfaces and across a variety of repositories. With Pierre, four kinds of interfaces are generated: web, stand-alone application, text-menu, and command line. The kinds of repositories with which Pierre interfaces have been used are relational, XML and object databases.},	keywords={Computational Biology/*methods/trends; *Databases, Factual/trends; *Models, Biological; *Software Design},	isbn={1471-2105 (Electronic)},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:76,	author={K.

However, there is, as yet, no formally accepted standard representation to support the sharing of proteomics data, and little systematic dissemination of comprehensive proteomic data sets. RESULTS: This paper describes the design, implementation and use of a Proteome Experimental Data Repository (PEDRo), which makes comprehensive proteomics data sets available for browsing, searching and downloading. It is also serves to extend the debate on the level of detail at which proteomics data should be captured, the sorts of facilities that should be provided by proteome data management systems, and the techniques by which such facilities can be made available. CONCLUSIONS: The PEDRo database provides access to a collection of comprehensive descriptions of experimental data sets in proteomics. Not only are these data sets interesting in and of themselves, they also provide a useful early validation of the PEDRo data model, which has served as a starting point for the ongoing standardisation activity through the Proteome Standards Initiative of the Human Proteome Organisation},	keywords={Human; Proteomics; standards},	url={PM:15377392}}}@article{RefWorks:77,	author={K.

As a first test of the FC-HCS technique, we used it to screen a 2000-compound library, called the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Diversity Set, to identify agents that would enhance the anti-lymphoma activity of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody rituximab. FC-HCS identified 15 compounds from the Diversity Set that significantly enhanced the ability of rituximab to inhibit cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis in lymphoma cells. The validity of the screening results was confirmed for several compounds using additional assays of cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell growth. The FC-HCS technique was relatively simple and reliable and could process up to 1000 samples/day on a single flow cytometer. The FC-HCS technique may be useful for a variety of applications including drug discovery, immunologic monitoring of patients, functional genomics studies and tissue engineering efforts},	keywords={analysis; Cell Cycle; Flow Cytometry; Genomics},	url={PM:15350512}}}@article{RefWorks:79,	author={Gene Ontology Consortium},	year={2004},	month={01/01/},	title={The Gene Ontology (GO) database and informatics resource},	journal={Nucleic acids research},	volume={32},	number={90001},	pages={D258-D261},	abstract={The Gene Ontology (GO) project (http://www. geneontology.org/) provides structured, controlled vocabularies and classifications that cover several domains of molecular and cellular biology and are freely available for community use in the annotation of genes, gene products and sequences.

Direct digitizing of the waveforms provides a means for the extraction of additional features, for example, pulse skewness and kurtosis, and Fourier properties. In this work, we have first demonstrated that the Fourier properties of the pulse can be employed usefully for discrimination between different types of cells that otherwise cannot be classified by using only time-domain features of the pulse. We then implemented and evaluated automatic procedures for cell classification based on neural networks. We established that neural networks could provide an efficient means of classification of cell types without the need for user interaction. The neural networks were also employed in an innovative manner for analysis of the digital flow cytometric data without feature extraction. The performance of the neural networks was compared with that of a more conventional means of classification, the K-means clustering algorithm. Neural networks can be realized in hardware, and this, in addition to their highly parallel architecture, makes them an important potential part of real-time analysis systems. These results are discussed in terms of the design of a real-time digital data acquisition system for flow cytometry.},	keywords={Animals; Chickens; Erythrocytes/cytology; Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/methods; Lymphoma/pathology; Mice; Microspheres; Neural Networks (Computer); Plants, Toxic; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Software; Tobacco; Tumor Cells, Cultured},	isbn={0196-4763},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:188,	author={H.

GVHD occurs when transplanted donor T lymphocytes react to foreign host cells. It causes a wide variety of host tissue injuries. This review focuses on the pathobiological basis, clinical aspects, and current management strategies of acute GVHD. Afferent phase of acute GVHD starts with myeloablative conditioning, i.e., before the infusion of the graft. Total-body irradiation (TBI) or high-dose chemotherapy regimens cause extensive damage and activation in host tissues, which release inflammatory cytokines and enhance recipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. Recognition of the foreign host antigens by donor T cells and activation, stimulation, and proliferation of T cells is crucial in the afferent phase. Effector phase of acute GVHD results in direct and indirect damage to host cells. The skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver are major target organs of acute GVHD. Combination drug prophylaxis in GVHD is essential in all patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Steroids have remained the standard for the treatment of acute GVHD. Several clinical trials have evaluated monoclonal antibodies or receptor antagonist therapy for steroid-resistant acute GVHD, with different successes in a variety of settings. There are some newer promising agents like mycophenolate mofetil, glutamic acid-lysine-alanine-tyrosine (GLAT), rapamycin, and trimetrexate currently entering in the clinical studies, and other agents are in development. Future experimental and clinical studies on GVHD will shed further light on the better understanding of the disease pathobiology and generate the tools to treat malignant disorders with allogeneic HSCT with specific graft-vs-tumor effects devoid of GVHD.},	keywords={Acute Disease; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration &amp; dosage/therapeutic use; Antigen Presentation; Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects; Bone Marrow/drug effects/immunology/pathology/radiation effects; Digestive System/drug effects/immunology/pathology/radiation effects; Dogs; Drug Design; Drug Therapy, Combination; Forecasting; Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/genetics/immunology/pathology/prevention &amp; control/therapy; HLA Antigens/immunology; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents/administration &amp; Liver/drug effects/immunology/pathology/radiation effects; Lymphocyte Depletion; Lymphokines/physiology; Mice; Models, Biological; Premedication; Radiation Chimera; Radiation Injuries/immunology/pathology; Randomized Controlled Trials; Receptors, Interleukin-2/antagonists &amp; inhibitors; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Skin/drug effects/immunology/pathology/radiation effects; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/transplantation; Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects; Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/immunology; Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects},	isbn={0301-472X},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:81,	author={J.

However, while the use of microarrays has expanded, and the issues of performance optimization have been intensively studied, the fundamental issue of data integrity management has largely been ignored. Now that performance has improved so greatly, the shortcomings of data integrity control methods constitute a greater percent of the stumbling blocks for investigators. Microarray data are cumbersome, and the rule up to this point has mostly been one of hands-on transformations, leading to human errors which often have dramatic consequences. We show in this review that the time lost on such mistakes is enormous and dramatically affects results; therefore, mistakes should be mitigated in any way possible. We outline the scope of the data integrity issue, to survey some of the most common and dangerous data transformations, and their shortcomings. To illustrate, we review some case studies. We then look at the work done by the research community on this issue (which admittedly is meager up to this point). Some data integrity issues are always going to be difficult, while others will become easier-one of our goals is to expedite the use of integrity control methods.

All of them discharge compounds (hydrocarbons, excess nutrients, heavy metals, chemicals, etc.) that can alter the marine ecosystem. To investigate whether ultraphytoplankton (<10 microm) could be used as biosensors for their own ecosystem, a 2-year survey was conducted in the Bay of Marseilles. METHODS: Seven stations monitored water mass and potential anthropic effects in the bay. Seawater samples were collected monthly or bimonthly at three depths, prefiltered, fixed, and kept in liquid nitrogen until flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: Five categories were created: Prochlorococcus, picoeukaryotes (<2 microm), nanoeukaryotes I (2--6 microm), nanoeukaryotes II (6--10 microm), and Synechococcus (<1.5 microm). Artificial neural network analysis (Kohonen self-organizing maps) produced the same number of clusters as cluster analysis with Winlist software (Verity Software House).

The proteins contained in total yeast cell lysate were separated by high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. Over 150 protein spots were excised and identified by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Protein spots were quantified by metabolic labeling and scintillation counting. Corresponding mRNA levels were calculated from serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) frequency tables (V. E.

We found that the correlation between mRNA and protein levels was insufficient to predict protein expression levels from quantitative mRNA data. Indeed, for some genes, while the mRNA levels were of the same value the protein levels varied by more than 20-fold. Conversely, invariant steady-state levels of certain proteins were observed with respective mRNA transcript levels that varied by as much as 30-fold. Another interesting observation is that codon bias is not a predictor of either protein or mRNA levels.

Like proteomics, flow cytometry (FCM) assesses concurrent expression of many proteins, with the advantage of using intact cells that may be differentially selected during analysis. However, FCM has generally been used for incremental marker validation or construction of predictive models based on known patterns, rather than as a tool for unsupervised class discovery. We undertook a retrospective analysis of clinical FCM data to assess the feasibility of a cell-based proteomic approach to FCM by unsupervised cluster analysis. METHODS: Multicolor FCM data on peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) lymphocytes from 140 consecutive patients with B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), including 81 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLLs), were studied. Expression was normalized for CD19 totals, and recorded for 10 additional B-cell markers. Data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis using complete linkage by Pearson's correlation. Analysis of CLL in PB samples (n = 63) discovered three major clusters. One cluster (14 patients) was skewed toward "atypical" CLL and was characterized by high CD20, CD22, FMC7, and light chain, and low CD23. The remaining two clusters consisted almost entirely (48/49) of cases recorded as typical BCLL. The smaller "typical" BCLL cluster differed from the larger cluster by high CD38 (P = 0.001), low CD20 (P = 0.001), and low CD23 (P = 0.016). These two typical BCLL clusters showed a trend toward a difference in survival (P = 0.1090). Statistically significant cluster stability was demonstrated by expanding the dataset to include BM samples, and by using a method of random sampling with replacement. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the concept that unsupervised immunophenotypic profiling of FCM data can yield reproducible subtypes of lymphoma/chronic leukemia. Expanded studies are warranted in the use of FCM as an unsupervised class discovery tool, akin to other proteomic methods, rather than as a validation tool.},	keywords={Aged; Antigens, CD20/analysis; Antigens, CD22/analysis; Antigens, CD38/analysis; Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/pathology; Cluster Analysis; Female; Flow Cytometry; Glycoproteins/analysis; Humans; Immunophenotyping/methods; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology/pathology; Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology; Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/immunology/pathology; Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/immunology/pathology; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Proteomics/methods; Receptors, IgE/analysis; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis},	isbn={1552-4949},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:400,	author={S.

Prognostic models capable of predicting outcome are essential. In 3 sequential clinical trials, conducted from January 1993 to August 2000, we treated 150 patients with relapsed or primary refractory DLBCL with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) chemotherapy followed by HDT/ASCT for patients with chemosensitive disease. We evaluated the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index at the initiation of second-line therapy (sAAIPI) as a predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). At a median follow-up of 4 years, the PFS and OS are 28% and 34% by intention to treat and 39% and 45% for only those patients with chemosensitive disease. Three risk groups with different PFS and OS were identified by the sAAIPI: low risk (0 factors), 70% and 74%; intermediate risk (1 factor), 39% and 49%; and high risk (2 or 3 factors), 16% and 18% (P <.001 for both PFS and OS). The sAAIPI also predicts the PFS and OS for patients with ICEchemosensitive disease: low risk, 69% and 83%; intermediate risk, 46% and 55%; and high risk, 25% and 26% (P <.001 PFS and OS). The sAAIPI predicts outcome for patients with relapsed or primary refractory DLBCL in both intent-to-treat and chemosensitive populations. This powerful prognostic instrument should be used to evaluate new treatment approaches and to compare results of different regimens.},	keywords={Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use; Carboplatin/therapeutic use; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease-Free Survival; Etoposide/therapeutic use; Female; Humans; Ifosfamide/therapeutic use; Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/therapy; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/mortality/therapy; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Stem Cell Transplantation; Survival Rate; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome},	isbn={0006-4971},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1420,	author={D.

It is compliant with all standards for microarray meta-data capture; including the specification of what data should be recorded, extensive use of standard ontologies and support for data exchange formats. The output from maxdLoad2 is of a form acceptable for submission to the ArrayExpress microarray repository at the European Bioinformatics Institute. maxdBrowse is a PHP web-application that makes contents of maxdLoad2 databases accessible via web-browser, the command-line and web-service environments. It thus acts as both a dissemination and data-mining tool. RESULTS: maxdLoad2 presents an easy-to-use interface to an underlying relational database and provides a full complement of facilities for browsing, searching and editing. There is a tree-based visualization of data connectivity and the ability to explore the links between any pair of data elements, irrespective of how many intermediate links lie between them. Its principle novel features are: the flexibility of the meta-data that can be captured, the tools provided for importing data from spreadsheets and other tabular representations, the tools provided for the automatic creation of structured documents, the ability to browse and access the data via web and web-services interfaces.Within maxdLoad2 it is very straightforward to customise the meta-data that is being captured or change the definitions of the meta-data. These meta-data definitions are stored within the database itself allowing client software to connect properly to a modified database without having to be specially configured. The meta-data definitions (configuration file) can also be centralized allowing changes made in response to revisions of standards or terminologies to be propagated to clients without user intervention.maxdBrowse is hosted on a web-server and presents multiple interfaces to the contents of maxd databases. maxdBrowse emulates many of the browse and search features available in the maxdLoad2 application via a web-browser. This allows users who are not familiar with maxdLoad2 to browse and export microarray data from the database for their own analysis. The same browse and search features are also available via command-line and SOAP server interfaces. This both enables scripting of data export for use embedded in data repositories and analysis environments, and allows access to the maxd databases via web-service architectures. CONCLUSION: maxdLoad2 http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/microarray/maxd/ and maxdBrowse http://dbk.ch.umist.ac.uk/maxdBrowse are portable and compatible with all common operating systems and major database servers. They provide a powerful, flexible package for annotation of microarray experiments and a convenient dissemination environment. They are available for download and open sourced under the Artistic License.},	keywords={Data Interpretation, Statistical; Information Dissemination/methods; Internet; Microarray Analysis/instrumentation/methods; Software; User-Computer Interface},	isbn={1471-2105},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:162,	author={J.

Much recent research in bioinformatics has therefore been focused on the transfer of clustering methods introduced in other scientific fields and on the development of novel algorithms specifically designed to tackle the challenges posed by post-genomic data. The partitions returned by a clustering algorithm are commonly validated using visual inspection and concordance with prior biological knowledge--whether the clusters actually correspond to the real structure in the data is somewhat less frequently considered. Suitable computational cluster validation techniques are available in the general data-mining literature, but have been given only a fraction of the same attention in bioinformatics. RESULTS: This review paper aims to familiarize the reader with the battery of techniques available for the validation of clustering results, with a particular focus on their application to post-genomic data analysis. Synthetic and real biological datasets are used to demonstrate the benefits, and also some of the perils, of analytical clustervalidation.

Morphologically, the LCLs were classified in ten cases as centroblastic lymphoma (malignant lymphoma, diffuse, large cell, non-cleaved cell), in three cases as immunoblastic lymphoma (malignant lymphoma, large cell, immunoblastic), and in one case as large cell anaplastic lymphoma. Eleven of the 14 LCLs were studied immunohistologically. Five cases showed a monotypic immunoglobulin (Ig) pattern, seven were positive to the monoclonal B-cell marker Ki-B3, and three showed both monotypic Ig and Ki-B3 positivity. With anti-Ig and Ki-B3, nine of the 11 LCLs could be classified as B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Only one case of LCL exhibited the typical phenotype of Hodgkin cells, ie, positivity to anti-CD15 (3C4) and anti-CD30 (Ber-H2). A retrospective follow-up study of these secondary LCLs of B type revealed a longer survival time than that of primary B-type LCLs and other secondary LCLs. These findings indicate that B-type LCL is the most common outcome when NP progresses into a lesion of higher malignancy and provide further evidence of a close relationship of NP to the B-cell system. They also suggest that it would be clinically relevant to distinguish between cases of B-type LCLs secondary to NP and cases of LCLs without association with NP. This implies that signs of a preexisting NP should be looked for when a B-type LCL is diagnosed.},	keywords={Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal; B-Lymphocytes; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology; Child; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hodgkin Disease/immunology/pathology; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Lymphoma/pathology; Male; Middle Aged},	isbn={0046-8177},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1244,	author={C.

Thus to prevent possible incomplete replication and instability of the termini of linear DNA, eukaryotic chromosomes end in characteristic repetitive DNA sequences within specialized structures called telomeres. In immortal cells, loss of telomeric DNA due to degradation or incomplete replication is apparently balanced by telomere elongation, which may involve de novo synthesis of additional repeats by novel DNA polymerase called telomerase. Such a polymerase has been recently detected in HeLa cells. It has been proposed that the finite doubling capacity of normal mammalian cells is due to a loss of telomeric DNA and eventual deletion of essential sequences. In yeast, the est1 mutation causes gradual loss of telomeric DNA and eventual cell death mimicking senescence in higher eukaryotic cells. Here, we show that the amount and length of telomeric DNA in human fibroblasts does in fact decrease as a function of serial passage during ageing in vitro and possibly in vivo. It is not known whether this loss of DNA has a causal role in senescence.},	keywords={Aging; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Chromosomes/ultrastructure; Fibroblasts; Humans},	isbn={0028-0836},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1245,	author={D.

Here we show that in most of the colorectal carcinomas that we analysed, there is a reduction in the length of telomere repeat arrays relative to the normal colonic mucosa from the same patient. We speculate on the consequences of this loss for tumorigenesis. We also show that the telomere arrays are much smaller in colonic mucosa and blood than in fetal tissue and sperm, and that there is a reduction in average telomere length with age in blood and colon mucosa. We propose that the telomerase is inactive in somatic tissues, and that telomere length is an indicator of the number of cell divisions that it has taken to form a particular tissue and possibly to generate tumours.},	keywords={Adenoma/genetics; Aging/genetics; Autoradiography; Carcinoma/genetics; Cell Division; Chromosomes/ultrastructure; Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics; DNA/blood/genetics/metabolism; DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa/analysis; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Oligonucleotide Probes; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid},	isbn={0028-0836},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:20,	author={W.

Newer-generation machines, using three- and four-color panels, make measurements of lymphocyte subsets ever more accurate and potentially cost-effective. Similarly, recent single-platform techniques promise even more efficiencies, freeing CD4 enumeration from parallel determination of the CBC. In other developments, quantitative reporting of immunophenotype may well change the way subsets traditionally defined by qualitative determinations are viewed. The most promising initial candidates for such changes are surrogates of immune activation, such as CD38 expression on CD8 cells. But technical demonstration of reproducibility and reliability, and clinical trial evidence of utility--especially as measured against such established laboratory parameters as CD4 cell and HIV RNA determinations--are needed before a change from qualitative to quantitative immunophenotype measurement can be widely accepted. Although too soon to tell if they will emerge from the research arena into the clinical arena, tetramer binding, intracellular cytokine detection, and assays of cell division are rapidly advancing understanding of HIV-disease, and indeed understanding of all of human immunology. Some of these assays provide often subtly different information, and together they will help determine the most important surrogate measures of clinical immunity. Identifying such surrogates is critical to developing a rational HIV vaccine. The power of flow cytometry is its ability simultaneously to analyze data in four, five, six, or more dimensions. For longitudinal experiments, time adds yet another dimension. Humans struggle to think past three dimensions; interpreting results from experimental permutations and combinations that expand geometrically with each additional parameter studied requires considerable effort. Ultimately computer programs might come to our aid, but for now we have to live with the information overload if we hope to gain insight into the workings of complex biologic systems. In a world of limited resources, and with limited capacity to conceptualize in multiple dimensions, insight, inspiration, and perhaps a little luck are needed to ask the right questions and use the right assays if the recent string of advances against AIDS is to continue},	keywords={Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; etiology; Flow Cytometry; Human; immunology; Immunophenotyping; instrumentation; methods; pathology; trends},	url={PM:11770291}}}@article{RefWorks:1419,	author={L.

The system is fully compliant with the Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) convention. MIMAS provides life scientists with a highly flexible and focused GeneChip data storage and annotation platform essential for subsequent analysis and interpretation of experimental results with clustering and mining tools. The system software can be downloaded for academic use upon request. CONCLUSION: MIMAS implements a novel concept for nation-wide GeneChip data management whereby a network of facilities is centered on one data node directly connected to the European certified public microarray data repository located at the EBI. The solution proposed may serve as a prototype approach to array data management between research institutes organized in a consortium.},	keywords={Database Management Systems; Databases, Genetic; Documentation/methods; Gene Expression Profiling/methods; Information Storage and Retrieval/methods; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods; Signal Transduction/physiology; Software; User-Computer Interface},	isbn={1471-2105},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:88,	author={H.

Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems introduced the commercial machines in the early 1970s, using the Stanford patent and expertise supplied by the Herzenberg Laboratory and a Becton Dickinson engineering group under Bernie Shoor. Over the years, we have increased the number of measured FACS dimensions (parameters) and the speed of sorting to where we now simultaneously measure 12 fluorescent colors plus 2 scatter parameters. In this history, I illustrate the great utility of this state-of-the-art instrument, which allows us to simultaneously stain, analyze, and then sort cells from small samples of human blood cells from AIDS patients, infants, stem cell transplant patients, and others. I also illustrate analysis and sorting of multiple subpopulations of lymphocytes by use of 8-12 colors. In addition, I review single cell sorting used to clone and analyze hybridomas and discuss other applications of FACS developed over the past 30 years, as well as give our ideas on the future of FACS. These ideas are currently being implemented in new programs using the internet for data storage and analysis as well as developing new fluorochromes, e.g., green fluorescent protein and tandem dyes, with applications in such areas as apoptosis, gene expression, cytokine expression, cell biochemistry, redox regulation, and AIDS. Finally, I describe new FACS methods for measuring activated kinases and phosphatases and redox active enzymes in individual cells simultaneously with cell surface phenotyping.

This vast repository is still underutilized due to the lack of methods for fast, accurate exploration of the entire compendium. Results: We have collected S. cerevisiae gene expression microarray data containing roughly 2400 experimental conditions. We analyzed the functional coverage of this collection and we designed a context-sensitive search algorithm for rapid exploration of the compendium. A researcher using our system provides a small set of query genes to establish a biological search context; based on this query, we weight each dataset's relevance to the context, and within these weighted datasets we identify additional genes that are co-expressed with the query set. Our method exhibits an average increase in accuracy of 273% compared to previous mega-clustering approaches when recapitulating known biology.

Both morphologically and prognostically it represents a diverse spectrum of disease. Traditional morphologic subclassification often results in poor interobserver reproducibility and has not been particularly helpful in predicting outcome. Recent gene expression profiling studies have classified diffuse large B-cell lymphoma into 2 main subtypes, germinal center B-cell and activated B-cell, with the germinal center type showing an overall better survival. Validation of these subtypes has become possible for the practicing pathologist with the use of surrogate immunohistochemical markers. Importantly however, these prognostic studies were performed on material from the pre-rituximab treatment era. With the now well-accepted addition of rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) to the typical large B-cell lymphoma chemotherapeutic regimen, a revalidation of any survival differences between the large B-cell lymphoma subgroups is necessary. This short review covers the current clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, genetic, gene expression profiling, and prognostic (studies before and after the addition of rituximab) features of de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.},	keywords={Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use; Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use; Doxorubicin/therapeutic use; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Germinal Center/pathology; Humans; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/genetics/pathology; Prednisone/therapeutic use; Prognosis; Tumor Markers, Biological/analysis; Vincristine/therapeutic use},	isbn={1543-2165},	language={eng}}}@misc{RefWorks:412,	author={IBM},	title={IBM Research - Eclipse},	volume={2008},	number={03/08}}}@article{RefWorks:200,	author={T.

In order to gain a better understanding of acute GVHD in the liver, we compared the gene expression profiles of livers after experimental allogeneic and syngeneic BMT using oligonucleotide microarray. At 35 days after allogeneic BMT when hepatic GVHD was histologically evident, genes related to cellular effectors and acute-phase proteins were up-regulated, whereas genes largely related to metabolism and endocrine function were down-regulated. At day 7 after BMT before the development of histologic changes in the liver, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible genes, major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules, and genes related to leukocyte trafficking had been up-regulated. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that expression of IFN-gamma protein itself was increased in the spleen but not in hepatic tissue. These results suggest that the increased expression of genes associated with the attraction and activation of donor T cells induced by IFN-gamma early after BMT is important in the initiation of hepatic GVHD in this model and provide new potential molecular targets for early detection and intervention of acute GVHD.},	keywords={Acute-Phase Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics; Animals; Antigen Presentation/genetics; Apoptosis/genetics; Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects; Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/genetics; Comparative Study; Expressed Sequence Tags; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects; Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/metabolism/pathology; Inflammation/genetics; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/genetics; Interferon Type II/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology; Liver/drug effects/metabolism/pathology; Lymphocyte Activation/genetics; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Organ Specificity; Radiation Chimera; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Spleen/metabolism; T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism; Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects; Transplantation, Isogeneic},	isbn={0006-4971},	language={eng}}}@misc{RefWorks:236,	author={IEEE},	title={IEEE 754: Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic}}}@article{RefWorks:90,	author={R.

DATA EXTRACTION: Approximately 100 data sources were analyzed, and those with the most relevant information were selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: The diagnosis of many primary immunodeficiency diseases requires the use of several laboratory tests. Flow cytometry has become an important part of the workup of individuals suspected to have such a disorder. Knowledge of the pathogenesis of many of these diseases continues to increase, hence we acquire a better understanding of the laboratory tests that may be helpful in diagnosis.

Despite following largely parallel routes to date, the goals and principles of evidence-based and molecular medicine are complementary and they should be converging. I define molecular evidence-based medicine as the study of medical information that makes sense of the advances of molecular biological disciplines and where errors and biases are properly appreciated and placed in context. Biomedical measurement capacity improves very rapidly. The exponentially growing mass of hypotheses being tested requires a new approach to both statistical and biological inference. Multidimensional biology requires careful exact replication of research findings, but indirect corroboration is often all that is achieved at best. Besides random error, bias remains a major threat. It is often difficult to separate bias from the spirit of scientific inquiry to force data into coherent and 'significant' biological stories. Transparency and public availability of protocols, data, analyses and results may be crucial to make sense of the complex biology of human disease and avoid being flooded by spurious research findings. Research efforts should be integrated across teams in an open, sharing environment.

Profiles of cancer cell signaling networks might therefore identify mechanisms by which such cells interpret environmental cues for continued growth. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we monitored phospho-protein responses to environmental cues in acute myeloid leukemia at the single cell level. By exposing cancer cell signaling networks to potentiating inputs, rather than relying upon the basal levels of protein phosphorylation alone, we could discern unique cancer network profiles that correlated with genetics and disease outcome. Strikingly, individual cancers manifested multiple cell subsets with unique network profiles, reflecting cancer heterogeneity at the level of signaling response. The results revealed a dramatic remodeling of signaling networks in cancer cells. Thus, single cell measurements of phospho-protein responses reveal shifts in signaling potential of a phospho-protein network, allowing for categorizing of cell network phenotypes by multidimensional molecular profiles of signaling.},	keywords={Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology; Carcinogens, Environmental/pharmacology; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism; Flow Cytometry/methods; Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism; MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology; Mutation/genetics; Phosphoproteins/analysis/genetics/metabolism; Phosphorylation/drug effects; Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism; STAT1 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics; Trans-Activators/metabolism; fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3; ras Proteins/metabolism},	isbn={0092-8674},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1482,	author={J.

The algorithms were developed using a dataset collected from CMV-infected infants and combined within a graphical user interface, to create the APT. The APT was used to identify regulatory T-cells in HIV-infected adults, based on expression of FOXP3. Results from the APT were compared directly with the manual analyses of five immunologists and showed close agreement, with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.96 (95% CI 0.91-0.98). The APT was well accepted by users and able to process around 100 data files per hour.

Data standards are required to enable the development of public data repositories and to improve data sharing. There is an established data format for microarrays (microarray gene expression markup language, MAGE-ML) and a draft standard for proteomics (PEDRo). We believe that all types of functional genomics experiments should be annotated in a consistent manner, and we hope to open up new ways of comparing multiple datasets used in functional genomics. RESULTS: We have created a functional genomics experiment object model (FGE-OM), developed from the microarray model, MAGE-OM and two models for proteomics, PEDRo and our own model (Gla-PSI-Glasgow Proposal for the Proteomics Standards Initiative). FGE-OM comprises three namespaces representing (i) the parts of the model common to all functional genomics experiments; (ii) microarray-specific components; and (iii) proteomics-specific components. We believe that FGE-OM should initiate discussion about the contents and structure of the next version of MAGE and the future of proteomics standards. A prototype database called RNA And Protein Abundance Database (RAPAD), based on FGE-OM, has been implemented and populated with data from microbial pathogenesis.

The role that flow cytometry plays, however, extends beyond just diagnosis and classification. OBJECTIVE: To review and evaluate the current roles of flow cytometry in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, to compare it with immunohistochemistry, and to discuss its potential future applications in the molecular diagnostic era. DATA SOURCES: The information contained herein is derived from peer-reviewed articles on the subject published in the English-language medical literature during the years 1980 to 2005 that were identified using PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi, 1980-2005) search, various books and other sources on flow cytometry, and the author's personal experience of more than 10 years with flow cytometric analysis of lymphomas and leukemia using Becton-Dickinson (San Jose, Calif) and Beckman-Coulter (Miami, Fla) flow cytometers. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected based on adequate material and methods, statistically significant results, and adequate clinical follow-up. DATA EXTRACTION: The data from various sources were compared when the methods used were the same or similar and appropriate controls were included. Most of the studies employed 2-color, 3-color, or 4-color flow cytometers with antibodies from Becton-Dickinson, Beckman-Coulter, or DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, Calif). Results were evaluated from studies utilizing the same or similar techniques and flow cytometers. Only objective data analyses from relevant and useful publications were included for reporting and discussion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Flow cytometry serves a variety of roles in the field of lymphoma/leukemia including rapid diagnosis, proper classification, staging, minimal residual disease detection, central nervous system lymphoma detection, evaluation of prognostic markers, detection of target molecules for therapies, ploidy analysis of lymphoma cell DNA, and evaluation of multidrug-resistance markers. It offers many advantages in comparison to immunohistochemistry for the same roles and provides uses that are either not possible or not preferable by immunohistochemistry such as multiparameter evaluation of single cells and detection of clonality in T cells. CONCLUSIONS: By virtue of its ability to evaluate not only surface but also cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens, flow cytometry continues to enjoy widespread use in various capacities in lymphoma evaluation and treatment. Additional roles for flow cytometry are likely to be invented in the future and should provide distinctive uses in the molecular era.},	keywords={Clone Cells; Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/methods; Humans; Immunohistochemistry/methods; Immunophenotyping/methods; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology/pathology},	isbn={1543-2165},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1254,	author={EL Kaplan and P.

The objective of this study was to collect demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome information for infants and children who had Neisseria meningitidis infections of various serogroups and were cared for in 10 pediatric hospitals. METHODS: Investigators at each of the participating hospitals identified children with meningococcal infections and collected demographic and clinical information using a standard data form. Meningococcal isolates were sent to a central laboratory for serogrouping by slide agglutination and penicillin susceptibility. RESULTS: From January 1, 2001, through March 15, 2005, 159 episodes of systemic meningococcal infections were detected. The greatest numbers of children were younger than 12 months (n = 41) or were 12 to 24 months of age (n = 22). Meningitis was the most common clinical manifestation of disease accounting for 112 (70%) cases; 43 (27%) children had bacteremia only. Children who were younger than 5 years (17 of 102) were significantly less likely to require mechanical ventilation than children who were 5 to 10 years of age (12 of 24) or children who were older than 10 years (13 of 33). Overall, 55 (44%) isolates were serogroup B, 32 (26%) were serogroup C, and 27 (22%) were serogroup Y. All but 1 isolate (intermediate) were susceptible to penicillin. The overall mortality rate was 8% (13 of 159) but was greater for children who were > or = 11 years of age (7 [21.2%] of 33) than for children who were younger than 11 years (6 [4.8%] of 126). Unilateral or bilateral hearing loss occurred in 14 (12.5%) of 112 children with meningitis. CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity and the mortality of meningococcal infections are substantial. With the recent licensure of meningococcal conjugate vaccines, our baseline trends in meningococcal disease can be compared with those seen after widespread vaccination to assess the success of routine immunization.},	keywords={Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hearing Loss/etiology; Hospitals, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Meningococcal Infections/complications/mortality; Morbidity; Neisseria meningitidis; Population Surveillance; United States/epidemiology},	isbn={1098-4275},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1426,	author={M.

Examples include performing functional queries to sequence and pathway databases, and determining functional equality to evaluate algorithms that predict function from sequence. A prerequisite to computing with function is the existence of an ontology that provides a structured semantic encoding of function. Functional bioinformatics is an emerging subfield of bioinformatics that is concerned with developing ontologies and algorithms for computing with biological function. RESULTS: The article explores the notion of computing with function, and explains the importance of ontologies of function to bioinformatics. The functional ontology developed for the EcoCyc database is presented. This ontology can encode a diverse array of biochemical processes, including enzymatic reactions involving small-molecule substrates and macromolecular substrates, signal-transduction processes, transport events, and mechanisms of regulation of gene expression. The ontology is validated through its use to express complex functional queries for the EcoCyc DB.

DATA SOURCES: The 8 manuscripts submitted were reviewed, and their major findings were compared with literature on the same or related topics. STUDY SELECTION: Manuscripts address the use of molecular techniques in microbiology to evaluate infectious disease and epidemiology; molecular microbiology methods, including rapid-cycle real-time polymerase chain reaction; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma as a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer; the effect of nonapoptotic doses of the bisbenizamide dye Hoechst 33342 on luciferase expression in plasmid-transfected BC3H-1 myocytes; the routine use of cystic fibrosis screening and its challenges; and the use of flow cytometry and/or chromosomal translocation in the diagnostic evaluation of hematopoietic malignancies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Three current issues related to the use of molecular tests in clinical laboratories are (1) the restriction on introducing new tests secondary to existing patents or licenses; (2) the preanalytic variables for the different specimen types currently in use, including whole blood, plasma, serum, fresh or frozen tissues, and free-circulating DNA; and (3) the interpretation of studies evaluating the association of complex diseases with a single mutation or single-nucleotide polymorphism. Molecular methods have had a major impact on infectious disease through the rapid identification of organisms, the evaluation of outbreaks, and the characterization of drug resistance when compared with standard culture techniques. The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma stimulated by thiazolidinedione is useful in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus and may have value in preventing inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. Hoechst 33342 binding to adenine-thymine-rich regions in the minor groove of DNA is a fluorescent stain for DNA and initiates apoptosis at >10 microg/mL. Lower doses of Hoechst 33342 promote luciferase expression by a mechanism that may involve binding to cryptic promoters facilitated by dye-associated misalignment of the tertiary structure of DNA. The routine use of cystic fibrosis screening is complicated by the more than 1000 mutations associated with the disease. The use of 4-color flow cytometry and the detection of chromosomal translocation are both invaluable aids in establishing the diagnosis of lymphoid or myeloid hematopoietic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: The current postgenomic era will continue to emphasize the use of microarrays and database software for genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic screening in the search for useful clinical assays. The number of molecular pathologic techniques will expand as additional disease-associated mutations are defined},	keywords={Cystic Fibrosis; diagnosis; Flow Cytometry; Genetic Screening; genetics; Genomics; Human; methods; Mutation; pathology; Pathology,Clinical; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism,Single Nucleotide; Proteomics; Software; Transcription,Genetic; trends},	url={PM:12946210}}}@misc{RefWorks:184,  author = 	 { Kim},  year = 	 {2004},  title = 	 {On cluster validity index for estimation of the optimal number of fuzzy clusters},  journal = 	 {Pattern recognition},  volume = 	 {37},  number = 	 {10},  pages = 	 {2009},  isbn = 	 {0031-3203}}}@article{RefWorks:1451,	author={C.

Data-mining techniques were used to analyze the large experimental data sets to determine whether nonlinear, non-obvious responses could be extracted from the data. METHODS: Unary, binary, and ternary combinations of pharmacological factors (examples of stimuli) were used to induce differentiation of HL-60 cells using a HT automated approach. Cell profiles were analyzed by incorporating hierarchical clustering methods on data collected by flow cytometry. Data-mining techniques were used to explore the combinatorial space for nonlinear, unexpected events. Additional small-scale, follow-up experiments were performed on cellular profiles of interest. RESULTS: Multiple, distinct cellular profiles were detected using hierarchical clustering of expressed cell-surface antigens. Data-mining of this large, complex data set retrieved cases of both factor dominance and cooperativity, as well as atypical cellular profiles. Follow-up experiments found that treatment combinations producing "atypical cell types" made those cells more susceptible to apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS Hierarchical clustering and other data-mining techniques were applied to analyze large data sets from HT flow cytometry. From each sample, the data set was filtered and used to define discrete, usable states that were then related back to their original formulations. Analysis of resultant cell populations induced by a multitude of treatments identified unexpected phenotypes and nonlinear response profiles.},	keywords={Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Flow Cytometry/methods; HL-60 Cells; Humans},	isbn={1552-4922},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1302,	author={U.

The memory B-cell compartment generated in the GC reaction and characterized by cells bearing somatically mutated V-region genes consists not only of class-switched cells, but also of IgM-only B cells and perhaps a subset of IgM+IgD+B cells expressing the CD27 antigen. Comparison of the rearranged V-region genes of human B-cell lymphomas with those of the normal B-cell subsets allows the identification of the progenitor cells of these tumours in terms of their stage of maturation. On this basis, most B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and in addition Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in Hodgkin's disease (HD), are derived from B cells at a GC or post-GC stage of development. The mutation pattern indicates that the precursors of the tumour clones have been stringently selected for expression of a functional antigen receptor with one notable exception: HRS cells in classical (but not lymphocyte-predominant) HD appear to be derived from "crippled" GC B cells. Sequence analysis of rearranged V genes amplified from single tonsillar GC B cells revealed that the somatic hypermutation process introduces deletions and/or insertions into V-region genes more frequently than indicated by previous investigations. Presumably, this feature of the hypermutation mechanism is often responsible for the generation of heavy chain disease, and also several types of chromosomal translocations of oncogenes into immunoglobulin loci in human B-cell lymphomas.},	keywords={Animals; Antibody Diversity/genetics; B-Lymphocytes/immunology; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics; Genes, Immunoglobulin; Humans; Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics; Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology; Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology; Mutation; Point Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction},	isbn={0105-2896},	language={eng}}}@inproceedings{RefWorks:1475,	author={Rainer Koschke and Thomas Eisenbarth},	year={2000},	title={A Framework for Experimental Evaluation of Clustering Techniques},	booktitle={IWPC '00: Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Program Comprehension},	publisher={IEEE Computer Society},	address={Washington, DC, USA},	pages={201},	isbn={0-7695-0656-9}}}@article{RefWorks:177,	author={Y.

Additionally, the subtype of leukemia based on the degree of differentiation and cell maturity influence prognosis, response to treatment, and median survival times. In this paper, we analyze immunophenotype flow cytometry data toward categorization of leukemia into subcategories based on lineage and differentiation antigen expression. Twenty-eight inputs (derived from the mean fluorescence intensity of up to 27 antibodies, and an additional binary input denoting the past diagnosis of leukemia) are used as input to a neural classifier to categorize a total of 170 cases into the lineage and differentiation categories of leukemia. The neural classifier consisted of a feed forward network trained using back propagation. A complexity regulation term (weight decay) was used to improve the generalization performance of the neural classifier. A training error of 0.0% and a generalization error of 10.3% was obtained for categorization based on lineage, while a training error of 0.0% and a generalization error of 10.0% was obtained for categorization based on differentiation. These results indicate that objective classification of multifaceted phenotypes in leukemia can be achieved for analyzing multiparameter data in flow cytometry and further categorization into the prognostic subtypes.},	keywords={Adult; Algorithms; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Lineage; Child; Female; Flow Cytometry; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Immunophenotyping/methods; Leukemia/classification; Male; Neural Networks (Computer); Prognosis},	isbn={0018-9294},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:170,	author={S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred seventy-two patients with LCL were retrieved from a population-based registry for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). bcl2 and p53 protein expression was studied on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry in relation to clinical factors. Response to therapy and survival were analyzed in 165 patients who were uniformly staged and treated and for whom all prognostic data were available according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI). RESULTS: Forty-five percent of tumors showed strong expression of the bcl2 protein (bcl2++), with a higher frequency in patients with primary nodal involvement. Disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly better in bcl2-negative/intermediate (bcl2-/+) cases as compared with bcl2++ cases (P = .0011). At 5 years, bcl2-/+ patients showed a DFS rate of 74%, in contrast to bcl2++ patients with a DFS rate of 41% (P = .002). Bcl2 was the strongest independent prognostic value in a multivariate analysis, with a relative risk (RR) of 3.0 in comparison to p53 expression and the clinical factors of the IPI. Overall survival (OS) was not significantly influenced by bcl2 protein expression. p53 protein expression was found in 13% of cases, with a higher frequency in patients with extensive disease. p53 expression did not influence the chance to achieve complete remission (CR) and survival. CONCLUSION: bcl2 protein is frequently expressed in LCL and is a strong independent prognostic factor for DFS. p53 expression is related with high tumor burden, but is not an independent risk factor for CR and survival.},	keywords={Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/mortality/pathology; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemistry/mortality/pathology; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Risk Factors; Tumor Markers, Biological/analysis; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis},	isbn={0732-183X},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1440,	author={P.

Here, we describe a high-content, cell-based drug discovery platform based on phosphospecific flow cytometry, or phosphoflow, that enabled screening for inhibitors against multiple endogenous kinase signaling pathways in heterogeneous primary cell populations at the single-cell level. From a library of small-molecule natural products, we identified pathway-selective inhibitors of Jak-Stat and MAP kinase signaling. Dose-response experiments in primary cells confirmed pathway selectivity, but importantly also revealed differential inhibition of cell types and new druggability trends across multiple compounds. Lead compound selectivity was confirmed in vivo in mice. Phosphoflow therefore provides a unique platform that can be applied throughout the drug discovery process, from early compound screening to in vivo testing and clinical monitoring of drug efficacy.},	keywords={Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Flow Cytometry/methods; Humans; Janus Kinases/metabolism; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism; Phosphorus/analysis; STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Transduction},	isbn={1552-4469},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:96,	author={P.

In this review, we examine the development of phospho-epitope, or phospho-specific, flow cytometry and the premises upon which the technique is based. Phospho-specific flow cytometry is compared to traditional biochemical methods, and its advantages, such as single cell analysis, multiparameter data acquisition, rapid protocols, and the ability to analyze rare cell subsets, are detailed. We also discuss the many technical considerations that must be addressed when developing new antibodies or analyzing new epitopes including antigen accessibility, stability of the phospho-epitope, fluorophore selection, surface phenotype integrity, and antibody suitability for staining epitopes inside fixed and permeabilized cells. The methods that have been used to date are described in light of these technical considerations. The importance of developing bioinformatic platforms in parallel with these techniques is emphasized due to the large, multiparameter datasets that are rapidly accumulated and which require more efficient data viewing and complex clustering methods than currently available for flow cytometric data. Finally, we discuss the potential clinical applications of phospho-specific flow cytometry in analyzing immune cell development and antigen-specific immune responses, as well as pharmacodynamic profiling of disease states or drug efficacy and specificity against particular signaling proteins},	keywords={analysis; Flow Cytometry; methods; Phenotype; Proteins},	url={PM:15047199}}}@article{RefWorks:243,	author={John A.

Because of the clinical utility of flow cytometry, it is necessary to have a standard consistent with the requirements of medical regulatory agencies. METHODS: We extended the existing mapping of FCS to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard to include list-mode data produced by flow cytometry, laser scanning cytometry, and microscopic image cytometry. FCS list-mode was mapped to the DICOM Waveform Information Object. We created a collection of Extensible Markup Language (XML) schemas to express the DICOM analytical cytologic text-based data types except for large binary objects. We also developed a cytometry markup language, CytometryML, in an open environment subject to continuous peer review. RESULTS: The feasibility of expressing the data contained in FCS, including list-mode in DICOM, was demonstrated; and a preliminary mapping for list-mode data in the form of XML schemas and documents was completed. DICOM permitted the creation of indices that can be used to rapidly locate in a list-mode file the cells that are members of a subset. DICOM and its coding schemes for other medical standards can be represented by XML schemas, which can be combined with other relevant XML applications, such as Mathematical Markup Language (MathML). CONCLUSIONS: The use of XML format based on DICOM for analytical cytology met most of the previously specified requirements and appears capable of meeting the others; therefore, the present FCS should be retired and replaced by an open, XML-based, standard CytometryML.},	keywords={Computer Communication Networks/*standards; Feasibility Studies; Flow Cytometry/*standards; Humans; Information Systems/*standards; *Programming Languages; *Software},	isbn={1552-4922 (Print)},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:101,	author={R.

However, in general, these methods do not take advantage of the fact that time is a continuous variable, and existing clustering methods often group biologically unrelated genes together. RESULTS: We propose a quadratic regression method for identification of differentially expressed genes and classification of genes based on their temporal expression profiles for non-cyclic short time-course microarray data. This method treats time as a continuous variable, therefore preserves actual time information. We applied this method to a microarray time-course study of gene expression at short time intervals following deafferentation of olfactory receptor neurons. Nine regression patterns have been identified and shown to fit gene expression profiles better than k-means clusters. EASE analysis identified over-represented functional groups in each regression pattern and each k-means cluster, which further demonstrated that the regression method provided more biologically meaningful classifications of gene expression profiles than the k-means clustering method. Comparison with Peddada et al.'s order-restricted inference method showed that our method provides a different perspective on the temporal gene profiles. Reliability study indicates that regression patterns have the highest reliabilities. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the proposed quadratic regression method improves gene discovery and pattern recognition for non-cyclic short time-course microarray data. With a freely accessible Excel macro, investigators can readily apply this method to their microarray data.},	isbn={1471-2105},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:419,	author={G.

A method is proposed for measuring the population dynamics of cells on the basis of their mRNA expression patterns. The population's expression pattern is modeled as the linear combination of mRNA expression from pure samples of cells, allowing reconstruction of the relative proportions of pure cell types in the population. Application of the method, termed expression deconvolution, to yeast grown under varying conditions reveals the population dynamics of the cells during the cell cycle, during the arrest of cells induced by DNA damage and the release of arrest in a cell cycle checkpoint mutant, during sporulation, and following environmental stress. Using expression deconvolution, cell cycle defects are detected and temporally ordered in 146 yeast deletion mutants; six of these defects are independently experimentally validated. Expression deconvolution allows a reinterpretation of the cell cycle dynamics underlying all previous microarray experiments and can be more generally applied to study most forms of cell population dynamics},	keywords={Biology; Cell Cycle; chemistry; Computational Biology; cytology; Gene Expression Profiling; genetics; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Support,Non-U.S.Gov't; Support,U.S.Gov't,Non-P.H.S},	url={PM:12934019}}}@article{RefWorks:210,	author={X.

The model leads to a principled statistical estimation procedure that produces more accurate estimates of the mean cell cycle length and the gene expression periodicity than existing heuristic approaches. A central component of the proposed procedure is the resynchronization of the observed transcription profile of each PE gene according to the PNM with estimated periodicity parameters. By using a two-component mixture-Beta model to approximate the PNM fitting residuals, we employ an empirical Bayes method to detect PE genes. We estimate that about one-third of the genes in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are likely to be transcribed periodically, and identify 822 genes whose posterior probabilities of being PE are greater than 0.95. Among these 822 genes, 540 are also in the list of 800 genes detected by Spellman. Gene ontology annotation analysis shows that many of the 822 genes were involved in important cell cycle-related processes, functions and components. When matching the 822 resynchronized expression profiles of three independent experiments, little phase shifts were observed, indicating that the three synchronization methods might have brought cells to the same phase at the time of release.},	keywords={Bayes Theorem; Cell Cycle/genetics; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal/genetics; Genome, Fungal; Models, Genetic; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Periodicity; Probability; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/genetics; Time Factors; Transcription, Genetic/genetics},	isbn={1362-4962},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:7,	author={Y.

To account for time dependency of the gene expression measurements over time and the noisy nature of the microarray data, the mixed-effects model using B-splines was introduced. This paper further explores such mixed-effects model in analyzing the time-course gene expression data and in performing clustering of genes in a mixture model framework. RESULTS: After fitting the mixture model in the framework of the mixed-effects model using an EM algorithm, we obtained the smooth mean gene expression curve for each cluster. For each gene, we obtained the best linear unbiased smooth estimate of its gene expression trajectory over time, combining data from that gene and other genes in the same cluster. Simulated data indicate that the methods can effectively cluster noisy curves into clusters differing in either the shapes of the curves or the times to the peaks of the curves. We further demonstrate the proposed method by clustering the yeast genes based on their cell cycle gene expression data and the human genes based on the temporal transcriptional response of fibroblasts to serum. Clear periodic patterns and varying times to peaks are observed for different clusters of the cell-cycle regulated genes. Results of the analysis of the human fibroblasts data show seven distinct transcriptional response profiles with biological relevance.

A hepatitic variant was recently recognized, with more than a 10-fold increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. This study defines the clinicopathologic features and prognostic implications of hepatitic GVHD compared with classic liver GVHD. METHOD: A total of 38 cases of hepatitic GVHD, 68 cases of classic liver GVHD, and 13 cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatitis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were analyzed. RESULTS: Hepatitic GVHD cases showed significantly higher ALT, AST, and ALP levels compared with classic liver GVHD cases (at onset, mean ALT: 154 vs. 58 U/L, P <0.001; AST: 167 vs. 77 U/L, P <0.001; at peak, ALT: 435 vs. 112 U/L, P <0.001; AST: 587 vs. 150 U/L, P <0.001; ALP: 416 vs. 238 U/L, P =0.001), persisted longer (74 vs. 32 days, P =0.006), and showed more lobular pathologic changes in biopsy (lobular changes: 16/26 vs. 4/19, P =0.007; hepatocyte necrosis: 16/26 vs. 6/19, P =0.008; acidophil bodies: 15/26 vs. 4/19, P =0.014) but less cholestasis (4/26 vs. 8/19, P =0.045). However, cumulative doses of immunosuppressants prescribed, response, and outcome were similar. Compared with hepatitic GVHD, HBV-related hepatitis occurred later (95 vs. 184 days, P =0.049), but clinical and biochemical profiles were similar, requiring liver biopsies for their distinction. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitic and classic liver GVHD differed biochemically and pathologically, but these differences showed no obvious impact on outcome. The distinction of hepatitic GVHD from other hepatitis is mandatory.},	keywords={Adolescent; Adult; Alanine Transaminase/blood; Alkaline Phosphatase/blood; Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood; Bilirubin/blood; Female; Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology/pathology; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects; Hepatitis/drug therapy/etiology/pathology; Hepatitis B/drug therapy/etiology/pathology; Humans; Liver Diseases/drug therapy/etiology/pathology; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Retrospective Studies; Transplantation, Homologous; Treatment Outcome},	isbn={0041-1337},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1454,	author={H.

Standardization of ICS among laboratories performing vaccine studies would provide a common platform by which to compare the immunogenicity of different vaccine candidates across multiple international organizations conducting clinical trials. As such, a study was carried out among several laboratories involved in HIV clinical trials, to define the inter-lab precision of ICS using various sample types, and using a common protocol for each experiment (see additional files online). RESULTS: Three sample types (activated, fixed, and frozen whole blood; fresh whole blood; and cryopreserved PBMC) were shipped to various sites, where ICS assays using cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 peptide mix or control antigens were performed in parallel in 96-well plates. For one experiment, antigens and antibody cocktails were lyophilised into 96-well plates to simplify and standardize the assay setup. Results ((CD4+)cytokine+ cells and (CD8+)cytokine+ cells) were determined by each site. Raw data were also sent to a central site for batch analysis with a dynamic gating template. Mean inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (C.V.) ranged from 17-44% depending upon the sample type and analysis method. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) yielded lower inter-lab C.V.'s than whole blood. Centralized analysis (using a dynamic gating template) reduced the inter-lab C.V. by 5-20%, depending upon the experiment. The inter-lab C.V. was lowest (18-24%) for samples with a mean of > 0.5% IFNgamma + T cells, and highest (57-82%) for samples with a mean of < 0.1% IFNgamma + cells. CONCLUSION: ICS assays can be performed by multiple laboratories using a common protocol with good inter-laboratory precision, which improves as the frequency of responding cells increases. Cryopreserved PBMC may yield slightly more consistent results than shipped whole blood. Analysis, particularly gating, is a significant source of variability, and can be reduced by centralized analysis and/or use of a standardized dynamic gating template. Use of pre-aliquoted lyophilized reagents for stimulation and staining can provide further standardization to these assays.},	keywords={Blood Preservation; Cryopreservation; Cytokines/blood; Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/immunology; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Flow Cytometry/methods/standards; Freeze Drying; Humans; Indicators and Reagents; Laboratories; Lymphocytes/chemistry; Phosphoproteins/blood; Reproducibility of Results; Specimen Handling; T-Lymphocytes/chemistry; Viral Matrix Proteins/blood},	isbn={1471-2172},	language={eng}}}@inbook{RefWorks:105,	author={HT Maecker and VC Maino},	year={2002},	title={Flow cytometric analysis of cytokines},	series={Manual of Clinical Laboratory Immunology},	publisher={ASM Press},	address={Washington, DC},	volume={6th},	keywords={analysis; Cytokines; immunology}}}@article{RefWorks:1421,	author={J.

However, increasing evidence based on the recent introduction of more quantitative assays for measuring antigen-specific T cells has suggested that the role of these cells in the development of a protective immune response to a particular viral pathogen may be determined by a complex interplay of multiple virologic and cellular factors. Thus, measurements of only the frequencies of the T cell subsets participating in the response to viral pathogens may be an incomplete reflection of efficacy. In this review, we suggest that some measurable factors may influence the role of T cell immunity in conferring protection, including functional avidity, epitope breadth and specificity, proliferative capacity, cytokine repertoire, degree of anergy, and differentiation phenotype, as well as magnitude, of viral-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. We suggest that automated cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) is an efficient approach to the measurement of the complex interplay of multiple immune parameters involved in immune protection. These ideas are discussed in the context of new developments in sample preparation and analysis automation.},	keywords={Animals; Antigens, Viral/immunology; Cytokines/analysis; Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/methods; Humans; Immunity, Cellular},	isbn={1521-6616},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:206,	author={V.

These techniques suffer from the drawback that they do not enable analysis of single cell responses in the context of unselected cellular backgrounds. In addition these methods are not sensitive enough to rapidly assess rare event responses characteristic of cognate memory T cell responses. This review discusses recently developed flow cytometric methods designed to rapidly assess leukocyte subset cytokine responses to polyclonal activators and specific antigen in PBMC and whole blood samples. These procedures determine the percentages of activated cells and the identification of leucocyte subsets capable of expressing various cytokines and cell surface antigens. The ability to assess key intracellular functional markers by multiparameter flow cytometry offers some unique advantages in a number of clinical applications. The technical simplicity and rapidity of the flow cytometric intracellular cytokine detection techniques described in this report, as well as the widespread availability of appropriate flow cytometers and cell surface directed antibodies in clinical laboratories, suggests the possibility that this technique could be broadly applicable to the clinical evaluation of immune status. Since any cell type can be identified with this approach, responses to a variety of clinically relevant stimuli in virtually any leukocyte subset can be evaluated including monocyte responses to LPS, and T cell responses to mitogens and a variety of bacterial and viral antigens. The significance of measuring low frequency antigen-specific responses with respect to clinical significance in assessing immune status in a variety of clinical conditions and determining efficacy or immunotoxicity of drugs and vaccine antigens is discussed.},	keywords={Animals; Cell Separation; Cytokines/biosynthesis; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology; Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism; T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/metabolism},	isbn={0196-4763},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:106,	author={F.

This ability has great significance in our comprehension of the mechanisms that bring about diseases in general and hematologic malignancies in particular.

At the beginning of therapy, 597 patients (81%) had rash, 369 (50%) had liver dysfunction and 396 (54%) had gut dysfunction. Initial treatment was with glucocorticoids (n = 531), cyclosporine (n = 170), antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (n = 156) or monoclonal antibody (n = 3) either singly (n = 633) or in combination (n = 107). Parameters of GVHD severity in each organ were recorded weekly, and evaluation of response was made using values at the initiation of secondary treatment or, for patients without such treatment, using values on day 29 of primary treatment or the last recorded value before death, whichever occurred first. Minimal criteria for improvement or progression were defined for each organ, but no attempt was made to define liver or gut outcome if another complication such as venocclusive disease or infectious enteritis was present. Improvement rates were 43% for skin disease, 35% for evaluable liver disease and 50% for evaluable gut disease. Overall complete or partial responses were seen in 44% of patients. Multivariate analyses were carried out to identify patient, disease or treatment factors associated with likelihood of overall improvement and likelihood of response in at least one organ. A similar analysis was also carried out to identify covariates associated with time to treatment failure (defined as initiation of secondary therapy or death not due to relapse of malignancy). In all three models, GVHD prophylaxis using cyclosporine combined with methotrexate was associated with favorable GVHD treatment outcome compared to prophylaxis with either agent alone, and treatment with glucocorticoids or cyclosporine was more successful than treatment with ATG. Other factors associated with unfavorable outcome in the model of time to treatment failure and also entered in one of the response models were recipient HLA disparity with the donor, presence of a liver complication other than GVHD, and early onset of GVHD. Results of this analysis indicate that glucocorticoids represent the best initial therapy available for treatment of acute GVHD, although much room for improvement remains.},	keywords={Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use; Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use; Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects; Cyclosporins/therapeutic use; Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use; Graft vs Host Disease/prevention &amp; control/therapy; Humans; Intestinal Diseases/etiology/therapy; Liver Diseases/etiology/therapy; Methotrexate/therapeutic use; Multivariate Analysis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Retrospective Studies; Skin Diseases/etiology/therapy},	isbn={0006-4971},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:254,	author={Paul J.

As with the larger field of gene expression analysis, toxicogenomics faces the problems of probe annotation and data comparison across different array platforms. Toxicogenomics studies are generally built on standard toxicology studies generating biological end point data, and as such, one goal of toxicogenomics is to detect relationships between changes in gene expression and in those biological parameters. These challenges are best addressed through data collection into a well-designed toxicogenomics database. A successful publicly accessible toxicogenomics database will serve as a repository for data sharing and as a resource for analysis, data mining, and discussion. It will offer a vehicle for harmonizing nomenclature and analytical approaches and serve as a reference for regulatory organizations to evaluate toxicogenomics data submitted as part of registrations. Such a database would capture the experimental context of in vivo studies with great fidelity such that the dynamics of the dose response could be probed statistically with confidence. This review presents the collaborative efforts between the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute ArrayExpress, the International Life Sciences Institute Health and Environmental Science Institute, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences National Center for Toxigenomics Chemical Effects in Biological Systems knowledge base. The goal of this collaboration is to establish public infrastructure on an international scale and examine other developments aimed at establishing toxicogenomics databases. In this review we discuss several issues common to such databases: the requirement for identifying minimal descriptors to represent the experiment, the demand for standardizing data storage and exchange formats, the challenge of creating standardized nomenclature and ontologies to describe biological data, the technical problems involved in data upload, the necessity of defining parameters that assess and record data quality, and the development of standardized analytical approaches.},	keywords={Animals; Databases, Genetic; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; International Cooperation; Reference Values; Research Design; Terminology as Topic; Toxicogenetics/statistics & numerical data},	isbn={0091-6765},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:161,	author={S.

Two thirds of the 51 patients were men, and the median age was 42 years. The disease was characteristically unilocular and cervical and axillary nodes were most often involved. Local recurrences were common (in 13 cases). Oncological treatment (irradiation, cytostatics, or both) was given to 20 patients, whereas 31 patients remained untreated as the original histological diagnosis was not malignant. Despite the lack of treatment, the prognosis was good. Relative actuarial survival for the whole material was 93% at five years and 80% at ten years. During follow-up, five patients developed a diffuse large-celled non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 4-11 years after the onset of HDLPN. The majority of the subsequent lymphomas cannot be therapy-induced as only one of these patients had previously been treated (irradiated). Transition to other types of Hodgkin's disease was observed only in two cases. It is concluded that HDLPN is a clinicopathological entity with a good prognosis, but that it may sometimes change into a more malignant lymphoma of the Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's type.},	keywords={Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Axilla; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Histiocytes/pathology; Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy; Humans; Hyperplasia; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphocytes/pathology; Lymphoma/pathology; Male; Middle Aged; Neck; Prognosis; Recurrence; Time Factors; Toxoplasmosis/pathology},	isbn={0008-543X},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1401,	author={S.

To date, transcriptional profiling has been used to highlight similarities between DLBCL tumor cells and normal B-cell subtypes and associate genes and pathways with unfavorable outcome. To identify robust and highly reproducible DL-BCL subtypes with comprehensive transcriptional signatures, we used a large series of newly diagnosed DLBCLs, whole genome arrays, and multiple clustering methods. Tumors were also analyzed for known common genetic abnormalities in DLBCL. There were 3 discrete subsets of DLBCL-"oxidative phosphorylation," "B-cell receptor/proliferation," and "host response" (HR)-identified characterized using gene set enrichment analysis and confirmed in an independent series. HR tumors had increased expression of T/natural killer cell receptor and activation pathway components, complement cascade members, macrophage/dendritic cell markers, and inflammatory mediators. HR DLB-CLs also contained significantly higher numbers of morphologically distinct CD2+/CD3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interdigitating S100+/gamma interferon-induced lysosomal transferase-positive (GILT+) CD1a-/CD123- dendritic cells. The HR cluster shared features of histologically defined T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma, including fewer genetic abnormalities, younger age at presentation, and frequent splenic and bone marrow involvement. These studies identify tumor microenvironment and host inflammatory response as defining features in DLBCL and suggest rational treatment targets in specific DLBCL subsets.},	keywords={Cluster Analysis; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Immunity/genetics; Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/genetics/pathology; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/genetics/pathology; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics; Signal Transduction/genetics},	isbn={0006-4971},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1314,	author={ Montserrat},	year={2001},	title={Prognostic factors in aggressive lymphoma: The contribution of novel biological markers},	journal={Annals of hematology},	volume={80},	pages={B42},	isbn={0939-5555}}}@misc{RefWorks:277,  author = 	 {Norman Morrison and A.

A commercial DSP board processes the captured data and sends the results over the IEEE 1394 bus to the host computer that provides a user interface for acquisition, display, analysis, and storage. The system collects list mode data, correlated pulse shapes, or streaming data from a variety of detector types using Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows host computers. It extracts pulse features not found on commercial systems with excellent sensitivity and linearity over a wide dynamic range. List mode data are saved in FCS 3.0 formatted files while streaming or correlated waveform data are saved in custom format files for postprocessing. Open, reconfigurable cytometric acquisition system is compact, scaleable, flexible, and modular. Programmable feature extraction algorithms have exciting possibilities for both new and existing applications.

We used DNA microarrays to explore the responses of human macrophages to a variety of bacteria. Macrophages responded to a broad range of bacteria with a robust, shared pattern of gene expression. The shared response includes genes encoding receptors, signal transduction molecules, and transcription factors. This shared activation program transforms the macrophage into a cell primed to interact with its environment and to mount an immune response. Further study revealed that the activation program is induced by bacterial components that are Toll-like receptor agonists, including lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, muramyl dipeptide, and heat shock proteins. Pathogen-specific responses were also apparent in the macrophage expression profiles. Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific responses revealed inhibition of interleukin-12 production, suggesting one means by which this organism survives host defenses. These results improve our understanding of macrophage defenses, provide insights into mechanisms of pathogenesis, and suggest targets for therapeutic intervention.},	keywords={Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine/pharmacology; Cells, Cultured; DNA, Complementary/genetics; Gram-Negative Bacteria/immunology; Gram-Positive Bacteria/immunology; Heat-Shock Proteins/pharmacology; Humans; Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology; Macrophage Activation/drug effects/immunology; Macrophages/drug effects/immunology/microbiology; Mycobacterium/immunology; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Teichoic Acids/pharmacology},	isbn={0027-8424},	language={eng}}}@misc{RefWorks:359,	author={Inc No Magic},	title={MagicDraw - a visual UML modeling and CASE tool.}}}@misc{RefWorks:1389,  author = 	 {Inc No Magic},  title = 	 {MagicDraw UML Community Edition},  volume = 	 {15.0}}}@inproceedings{RefWorks:113,	author={D.

After fluorescence compensation, some cell populations will have low means and include events with negative data values. Logarithmic presentation has been very useful in providing informative displays of wide-ranging flow cytometry data, but it fails to adequately display cell populations with low means and high variances and, in particular, offers no way to include negative data values. This has led to a great deal of difficulty in interpreting and understanding flow cytometry data, has often resulted in incorrect delineation of cell populations, and has led many people to question the correctness of compensation computations that were, in fact, correct. RESULTS:: We identified a set of criteria for creating data visualization methods that accommodate the scaling difficulties presented by flow cytometry data. On the basis of these, we developed a new data visualization method that provides important advantages over linear or logarithmic scaling for display of flow cytometry data, a scaling we refer to as "Logicle" scaling. Logicle functions represent a particular generalization of the hyperbolic sine function with one more adjustable parameter than linear or logarithmic functions. Finally, we developed methods for objectively and automatically selecting an appropriate value for this parameter. CONCLUSIONS:: The Logicle display method provides more complete, appropriate, and readily interpretable representations of data that includes populations with low-to-zero means, including distributions resulting from fluorescence compensation procedures, than can be produced using either logarithmic or linear displays. The method includes a specific algorithm for evaluating actual data distributions and deriving parameters of the Logicle scaling function appropriate for optimal display of that data. It is critical to note that Logicle visualization does not change the data values or the descriptive statistics computed from them.

Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},	keywords={Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval/methods; Models, Statistical; Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods},	isbn={0162-8828},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1357,	author={C.

The complex and dynamic cellular processes underlying physiological processes become subtly or grossly perturbed in human disease. A primary objective is to demystify this complexity by creating and establishing relevant model systems to study important aspects of human disease. Although significant technological advancements over the last decade in both genomic and proteomic arenas have enabled progress, accessing the complexity of cellular interactions that occur in vivo has been a difficult arena in which to make progress. Moreover, there are extensive challenges in translating research tools to clinical applications. Flow cytometry, over the course of the last 40 years, has revolutionized the field of immunology, in both the basic science and clinical settings, as well as having been instrumental to new and exciting areas of discovery such as stem cell biology. Multiparameter machinery and systems exist now to access the heterogeneity of cellular subsets and enable phenotypic characterization and functional assays to be performed on material from both animal models and humans. This review focuses primarily on the development and application of using activation-state readouts of intracellular activity for phospho-epitopes. We present recent work on how a flow cytometric platform is used to obtain mechanistic insight into cellular processes as well as highlight the clinical applications that our laboratory has explored. Furthermore, this review discusses the challenges faced with processing high-content multidimensional and multivariate data sets. Flow cytometry, as a platform that is well situated in both the research and clinical settings, can contribute to drug discovery as well as having utility for both biomarker and patient-stratification.},	keywords={Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures; Epitopes/analysis/immunology; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Medicine; Phosphoproteins/analysis/immunology; Proteomics/methods},	isbn={0105-2896},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1459,	author={U.

However, the data reduction and analysis involved in the resolution of hundreds of possible cellular subphenotypes identified, using a single polychromatic flow cytometry staining panel, presents a major obstacle to the successful application of this technology. METHODS: To generate two distinct collections of T cell populations with differentially expressed surface markers, cryopreserved lymph node cells from 5 melanoma patients vaccinated with the modified gp100(209-2M) melanoma peptide were stimulated with cognate peptide and cultured in either IL-21 + low-dose IL-2 or IL-15 + low-dose IL-2. In vitro stimulated (IVS) cells were interrogated using 8-color flow cytometry. Data were analyzed using Winlist Hyperlog and FCOM software, and 32 T cell subsets were resolved for each culture condition. Hierarchical clustering analysis was applied to the relative percentages of each subphenotype for both IVS conditions to determine if unique cell surface marker expression signatures were produced for each IVS culture. RESULTS: Sequential data analysis using Hyperlog and FCOM demonstrated that lymphocytes cultured in IL-21 + IL-2 had a distinctively different set of subphenotype signatures compared to cells grown in IL-15 + IL-2 for all 5 patients. Importantly, subsequent cluster analysis of all 32 subphenotype frequencies in each IVS test condition for all 5 patients reproducibly demonstrated that cellular subphenotypes produced after IL-21 + IL-2 IVS partitioned separately from subphenotypes produced by IL-15 + IL-2 IVS. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated sequential use of Hyperlog and FCOM software with cluster analysis algorithms for the reduction and analysis of polychromatic flow cytometry data produces an effective, rapid technique for the assessment of complex patterns of subphenotype expression between and within multiple test samples.

It is well recognized that cloned T cells are heterogeneous with regard to cytokine synthesis and, thus, in their ability to mediate specific immune responses, but the extent to which the patterns of cytokine secretion observed in cloned cells reflect actual populations of memory/effector T cells existing in vivo is largely unknown. Here, we report our findings using a multiparameter flow cytometric assay that allows simultaneous determination of an individual T-cell's ability to produce multiple cytokines and its phenotype after only short (4 to 8 hours) in vitro incubation with an activating stimulus and the secretion inhibitor Brefeldin A. This assay shows a rapid accumulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) in the cytoplasm of CD4+ cells after stimulation with either accessory cell-independent (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA] + ionomycin [I]) or accessory cell-dependent (staphylococcal enterotoxins [SE] A and B) T-cell-activating stimuli. Further analysis showed that production of gamma-IFN and IL-4 is predominantly, if not exclusively, restricted to the CD45ROhigh memory/effector T-cell subset, whereas IL-2 may be produced by both the CD45ROhigh and CD45ROlow subsets. Simultaneous determination of IL-2 and gamma-IFN production among CD45ROhigh/CD4+ T cells showed distinct subsets that produce each of these cytokines alone (an average of 30% for IL-2 alone, 8% for gamma-IFN alone), both (16%), or neither (46%). Similar analyses with the small IL-4-producing memory/effector T-cell subset (only 4.3% of total CD4+/CD45ROhigh T cells) showed that an average of 51% of these IL-4-producing cells also synthesize average of 51% of these IL-4-producing cells also synthesize IL-2, 23% synthesize only IL-4, 16% synthesize all three cytokines, and 9.6% synthesize IL-4 and gamma-IFN. These patterns of cytokine synthesis were found to be similar with both PMA + I and SEA/SEB stimulation and were observed in both peripheral blood memory/effector CD4+ T cells and in T cells of similar phenotype obtained from cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity sites. Taken together, these data strongly support the in vivo existence of human memory/effector T-cell subsets with "preprogrammed" cytokine synthesis potential, although they suggest that these subsets may be more complex than originally proposed in the TH1/TH2 hypothesis.},	keywords={Antigens, CD/analysis; Antigens, CD45/analysis; Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism; Cytokines/biosynthesis; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Delayed/immunology; Immunologic Memory; Interferon Type II/biosynthesis; Interleukin-2/biosynthesis; Ionomycin/pharmacology; Lymphocyte Activation; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Superantigens; T-Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate},	isbn={0006-4971},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1369,	author={A.

Although good results have been achieved, most systems tend to lack in one or more fields. A Grid based approach may provide a shared, standardized and reliable solution for storage and analysis of biological data, in order to maximize the results of experimental efforts. A Grid framework has been therefore adopted due to the necessity of remotely accessing large amounts of distributed data as well as to scale computational performances for terabyte datasets. Two different biological studies have been planned in order to highlight the benefits that can emerge from our Grid based platform. The described environment relies on storage services and computational services provided by the gLite Grid middleware. The Grid environment is also able to exploit the added value of metadata in order to let users better classify and search experiments. A state-of-art Grid portal has been implemented in order to hide the complexity of framework from end users and to make them able to easily access available services and data. The functional architecture of the portal is described. As a first test of the system performances, a gene expression analysis has been performed on a dataset of Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Expression Array RAE230A, from the ArrayExpress database. The sequence of analysis includes three steps: (i) group opening and image set uploading, (ii) normalization, and (iii) model based gene expression (based on PM/MM difference model). Two different Linux versions (sequential and parallel) of the dChip software have been developed to implement the analysis and have been tested on a cluster. From results, it emerges that the parallelization of the analysis process and the execution of parallel jobs on distributed computational resources actually improve the performances. Moreover, the Grid environment have been tested both against the possibility of uploading and accessing distributed datasets through the Grid middleware and against its ability in managing the execution of jobs on distributed computational resources. Results from the Grid test will be discussed in a further paper.},	keywords={Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Database Management Systems; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling/methods; Information Storage and Retrieval/methods; Models, Biological; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods; Software; User-Computer Interface},	isbn={1471-2105},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:119,	author={P.

This approach reveals distribution of cells in three major phases of the cycle (G1 vs S vs G2/M) and makes it possible to detect apoptotic cells with fractional DNA content. The third approach is based on the bivariate analysis of DNA content and proliferation-associated proteins. The expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin A, or cyclin B1 vs DNA content is presented as an example. This approach allows one to distinguish, for example, G0 from G1 cells, identify mitotic cells, or relate expression of other intracellular proteins to the cell cycle position. The fourth procedure relies on the detection of 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation to label the DNA-replicating cells},	keywords={analysis; Cell Cycle; Flow Cytometry; Proteins},	url={PM:15220539}}}@article{RefWorks:218,	author={H.

However, neither the standard GVHD grading system nor any of several revisions has been validated in the context of GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine. The 1994 Consensus Conference on Acute GVHD Grading held in Keystone in January 1994 provided an opportunity to: (1) review data regarding these standard criteria; (2) determine if there are sufficient data to revise these criteria; and (3) develop recommendations for reporting results of GVHD prevention trials. Data were provided for 8249 patients from 12 large transplant centers and 2 transplant registries. Standard GVHD grading criteria were found to distinguish different mortality risks and treatment response rates. Analysis of new data suggested that persistent nausea with histologic evidence of GVHD but no diarrhea be included as stage 1 gastrointestinal GVHD. Additional studies were recommended to evaluate heterogeneity of outcome within GVHD grades prior to making further revisions. To improve comparability between publications, reports of GVHD prevention trials should include an accurate description of the grading system used and should report actuarial rates of grades II-IV and III-IV GVHD corrected for graft failure and potential interventions for early relapse. Additional information should include indications for therapy of GVHD and response.

METHODS: An MDA is conceptualized and developed for a health clinic system to track patient information. A prototype of the MDA is implemented using an advanced MDA tool. The UML provides the underlying modeling support in the form of the class diagram. The PIM to PSM transformation rules are applied to generate the prototype application from the model. RESULTS: The result of the research is a complete MDA methodology to developing health care information systems. Additional insights gained include development of transformation rules and documentation of the challenges in the application of MDA to health care. Design guidelines for future MDA applications are described. The model has the potential for generalizability. The overall approach supports limited interoperability and portability. CONCLUSION: The research demonstrates the applicability of the MDA approach to health care information systems development. When properly implemented, it has the potential to overcome the challenges of platform (vendor) dependency, lack of open standards, interoperability, portability, scalability, and the high cost of implementation.},	isbn={1386-5056 (Print)},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:301,	author={A.

The pathophysiology of acute GVHD is complex and can be conceptualized to be a three-step process based on murine studies. In step 1, the conditioning regimen leads to the damage and activation of host tissues and induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. As a consequence, the expression of MHC antigens and adhesion molecules is increased enhancing the recognition of host alloantigens by donor T cells. Donor T-cell activation in step 2 is characterized by donor T cell interaction with host APCs and subsequent proliferation, differentiation and secretion of cytokines. Cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-gamma enhance T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cell responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. These inflammatory cytokines in turn stimulate production of inflammatory chemokines, thus recruiting effector cells into target organs. In step 3, effector functions of mononuclear phagocytes are triggered via a secondary signal provided by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that leaks through the intestinal mucosa damaged during step 1. This mechanism may result in the amplification of local tissue injury and further promotion of an inflammatory response, which, together with the CTL and NK components, leads to target tissue destruction in the transplant host. The following review discusses the three-step process of the pathophysiology of experimental acute GVHD.},	keywords={Acute Disease; Animals; Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology; Graft vs Host Disease/physiopathology; Humans; Stem Cell Transplantation; Transplantation, Homologous},	isbn={0278-0232},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1388,	author={D.

Smooth curves for individual trajectories are constructed as best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) estimates, combining data from that individual and the entire collection. This framework leads naturally to methods for examining the effects of covariates on the shapes of the curves.

For the most part, such compensation has been relatively simple, producing the desired rectilinear distributions. However, in the realm of multicolor analysis, visualization of compensated often results in unexpected distributions, principally the appearance of a large number of events on the axis, and even more disconcerting, an inability to bring the extent of compensated data down to "autofluorescence" levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mathematical model of detector measurements with variable photon intensities, spillover parameters, measurement errors, and data storage characteristics was used to illustrate sources of apparent error in compensated data. Immunofluorescently stained cells were collected under conditions of limiting light collection and high spillover between detectors to confirm aspects of the model. RESULTS: Photon-counting statistics contribute a nonlinear error to compensated parameters. Measurement errors and log-scale binning error contribute linear errors to compensated parameters. These errors are most apparent with the use of red or far-red fluorochromes (where the emitted light is at low intensity) and with large spillover between detectors. Such errors can lead to data visualization artifacts that can easily lead to incorrect conclusions about data, and account for the apparent "undercompensation" previously described for multicolor staining. CONCLUSIONS: There are inescapable errors arising from imperfect measurements, photon-counting statistics, and even data storage methods that contribute both linearly and nonlinearly to a "spreading" of a properly compensated autofluorescence distribution. This phenomenon precludes the use of "quadrant" statistics or gates to analyze affected data; it also precludes visual adjustment of compensation. Most importantly, it is impossible to properly compensate data using standard visual graphical interfaces (histograms or dot plots). Computer-assisted compensation is required, as well as careful gating and experimental design to determine the distinction between positive and negative events. Finally, the use of special staining controls that employ all reagents except for the one of interest (termed fluorescence minus one, or "FMO" controls) becomes necessary to accurately identify expressing cells in the fully stained sample},	keywords={Artifacts; Calibration; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Human; immunology; Immunophenotyping; Leukocytes,Mononuclear; methods; Models,Biological; Spectrum Analysis; Statistics},	url={PM:11746088}}}@article{RefWorks:35,	author={M.

Indeed, it is possible that such differences can only be identified in "n"-dimensional space, where "n" is the number of parameters measured. Therefore, computer assisted identification of such differences is necessary. Such a method could be used to identify responses (i.e., by comparing cell samples before and after stimulation) in exquisite detail by allowing complete analysis of the collected data on only those events which have responded. METHODS: Multivariate Probability Binning can be used to compare different datasets to identify the distance and statistical significance of a difference between the distributions. An intermediate step in the algorithm provides access to the actual locations within the n-dimensional comparison which are most different between the distributions. Gates based on collections of hyper-rectangular bins can then be applied to datasets, thereby selecting those events (or clusters of events) that are different between samples. We term this process Frequency Difference Gating. RESULTS: Frequency Difference Gating was used in several test scenarios to evaluate its utility. First, we compared PBMC subsets identified by solely by immunofluorescence staining: based on this training data set, the algorithm automatically generated an accurate forward and side-scatter gate to identify lymphocytes. Second, we applied the algorithm to identify subtle differences between CD4 memory subsets based on 8-color immunophenotyping data. The resulting 3-dimensional gate could resolve cells subsets much more frequent in one subset compared to the other; no combination of two-dimensional gates could accomplish this resolution. Finally, we used the algorithm to compare B cell populations derived from mice of different ages or strains, and found that the algorithm could find very subtle differences between the populations. CONCLUSION: Frequency Difference Gating is a powerful tool that automates the process of identifying events comprising underlying differences between samples. It is not a clustering tool; it is not meant to identify subsets in multidimensional space. Importantly, this method may reveal subtle changes in small populations of cells, changes that only occur simultaneously in multiple dimensions in such a way that identification by univariate or bivariate analyses is impossible. Finally, the method may significantly aid in the analysis of high-order multivariate data (i.e., 6-12 color flow cytometric analyses), where identification of differences between datasets becomes so time-consuming as to be impractical.

Such algorithms could be useful for comparing differences between samples based on several independent measurements, rather than differences based on any single measurement. It is conceivable that distributions could be completely distinct in multivariate space, but unresolvable in any combination of univariate histograms. Multivariate comparisons could also be useful for providing feedback about instrument stability, when only subtle changes in measurements are occurring. METHODS: We apply a variant of Probability Binning, described in the accompanying article, to multidimensional data. In this approach, hyper-rectangles of n dimensions (where n is the number of measurements being compared) comprise the bins used for the chi-squared statistic. These hyper-dimensional bins are constructed such that the control sample has the same number of events in each bin; the bins are then applied to the test samples for chi-squared calculations. RESULTS: Using a Monte-Carlo simulation, we determined the distribution of chi-squared values obtained by comparing sets of events from the same distribution; this distribution of chi-squared values was identical as for the univariate algorithm. Hence, the same formulae can be used to construct a metric, analogous to a t-score, that estimates the probability with which distributions are distinct. As for univariate comparisons, this metric scales with the difference between two distributions, and can be used to rank samples according to similarity to a control. We apply the algorithm to multivariate immunophenotyping data, and demonstrate that it can be used to discriminate distinct samples and to rank samples according to a biologically-meaningful difference. CONCLUSION: Probability binning, as shown here, provides a useful metric for determining the probability with which two or more multivariate distributions represent distinct sets of data. The metric can be used to identify the similarity or dissimilarity of samples. Finally, as demonstrated in the accompanying paper, the algorithm can be used to gate on events in one sample that are different from a control sample, even if those events cannot be distinguished on the basis of any combination of univariate or bivariate displays.

Concomitant advances in scalable computational algorithms are necessary to better utilize the information that is contained in these high-complexity experiments. The development of such tools has the potential to expand the utility of flow cytometric analysis from a predominantly hypothesis-driven mode to one of discovery, or hypothesis-generating research. A new method of analysis of flow cytometric data called Cytometric Fingerprinting (CF) has been developed. CF captures the set of multivariate probability distribution functions corresponding to list-mode data and then "flattens" them into a computationally efficient fingerprint representation that facilitates quantitative comparisons of samples. An experimental and synthetic data were generated to act as reference sets for evaluating CF. Without the introduction of prior knowledge, CF was able to "discover" the location and concentration of spiked cells in ungated analyses over a concentration range covering four orders of magnitude, to a lower limit on the order of 10 spiked events in a background of 100,000 events. We describe a new method for quantitative analysis of list-mode cytometric data. CF includes a novel algorithm for space subdivision that improves estimation of the probability density function by dividing space into nonrectangular polytopes. Additionally it renders a multidimensional distribution in the form of a one-dimensional multiresolution hierarchical fingerprint that creates a computationally efficient representation of high dimensionality distribution functions. CF supports both the generation and testing of hypotheses, eliminates sources of operator bias, and provides an increased level of automation of data analysis.},	keywords={Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Biology; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Flow Cytometry/standards/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear/classification/immunology; Models, Statistical; Multivariate Analysis; Quality Control},	isbn={1552-4930},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1435,	author={Ron Edgar and Michael Domrachev and Alex E.

Ontologies--specifications of the entities, their attributes and relationships among the entities in a domain of discourse--are increasingly enabling biomedical researchers to accomplish these tasks. In fact, bio-ontologies are beginning to proliferate in step with accruing biological data. The myriad of ontologies being created enables researchers not only to solve some of the problems in handling the data explosion but also introduces new challenges. One of the key difficulties in realizing the full potential of ontologies in biomedical research is the isolation of various communities involved: some workers spend their career developing ontologies and ontology-related tools, while few researchers (biologists and physicians) know how ontologies can accelerate their research. The objective of this review is to give an overview of biomedical ontology in practical terms by providing a functional perspective--describing how bio-ontologies can and are being used. As biomedical scientists begin to recognize the many different ways ontologies enable biomedical research, they will drive the emergence of new computer applications that will help them exploit the wealth of research data now at their fingertips.},	keywords={Computational Biology/methods; Databases, Factual; Documentation/methods; Information Storage and Retrieval/methods; Models, Biological; Natural Language Processing; Systems Integration; Vocabulary, Controlled},	isbn={1477-4054},	language={eng}}}@misc{RefWorks:278,  author = 	 {Daniel L.

Consistent differences in telomere length in CD8+ T-cell subsets were identified. Naive and memory CD4+ T lymphocytes in normal adults differed by around 2.5 kb in telomere length, in agreement with known replicative shortening of telomeres in lymphocytes in vivo. T-cell clones grown in vitro showed stabilization of telomere length after an initial decline and rare clones capable of growing beyond 100 population doublings showed variable telomere length. These results show that flow FISH can be used to measure specific nucleotide repeat sequences in single cells and indicate that the very large replicative potential of lymphocytes is only indirectly related to telomere length.},	keywords={Adult; Blotting, Southern; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure; Cell Death; Cell Division; Cell Separation/methods; Cells, Cultured; Fetal Blood; Flow Cytometry/methods; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods; Nucleic Acid Probes; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure; Telomere/ultrastructure},	isbn={1087-0156},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:132,	author={L.

FCS 1.0 provided a uniform file format allowing data acquired on one computer to be correctly read and interpreted on other computers running a variety of operating systems. That standard was modified in 1990 and adopted by the Society of Analytical Cytology as FCS 2.0. Here, we report on an update of the FCS 2.0 standard which we propose to designate FCS 3.0. We have retained the basic four segment structure of earlier versions (HEADER, TEXT, DATA and ANALYSIS) in order to maintain analysis software compatibility, where possible. The changes described in this proposal include a method to collect files larger than 100 megabytes (not possible in earlier versions of the standard), the inclusion of international characters in the TEXT portions of the file, a method of verifying data integrity using a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check, and increased keyword support for cluster analysis and time acquisition. This report summarizes the work of the ISAC Data File Standards Committee.

Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140 000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data.

Data analysis requires considerable expertise and time. The amount of data is quickly increasing as more and larger trials are performed, and thus there is a critical need for high-throughput methods of data analysis. A web-based flow cytometric analysis system, LabKey Flow, was developed for the analyses of data from standardized ICS assays. Using a gating template created manually in commercially available flow cytometric analysis software, the system automatically compensates and analyzes all data sets. Quality control queries were designed to identify potentially incorrect sample collections. Comparison of the semiautomated analysis performed by LabKey Flow and the manual analysis performed using FlowJo software demonstrated excellent concordance (concordance correlation coefficient > 0.990). Manual inspection of the analyses performed by LabKey Flow for eight-color ICS data files from several clinical vaccine trials indicated that template gates can appropriately be used for most data sets. Thus, the semiautomated LabKey Flow analysis system can accurately analyze large ICS data files. Routine use of the system does not require specialized expertise. This high-throughput analysis will provide great utility for rapid evaluation of complex multiparameter flow cytometric measurements collected from large clinical trials.

Nevertheless, there is no agreement on the utility of these methods. OBJECTIVE: To further define the utility of adjunctive FC of clinical NAB for the diagnosis and classification of lymphoma, and to determine if this approach is practicable in a routine clinical practice setting. SETTING: A community-based hospital. METHODS: Clinical NABs were submitted for adjunctive FC between June 1996 and September 1999 if initial smears were suspicious for lymphoma. Smears and cell block or needle core tissues were routinely processed and paraffin-section immunostains were performed if indicated. The final diagnosis was determined by correlating clinical and pathologic data, and the revised European-American classification criteria were used to subtype lymphomas. RESULTS: Needle aspiration/biopsies from 60 different patients were submitted for FC. Final diagnoses were lymphoma (n = 38), other neoplasm (n = 15), benign (n = 6), or insufficient (n = 1). For 38 lymphomas (20 primary, 18 recurrent), patients ranged in age from 32 to 86 years (mean, 62 years); samples were obtained from the retroperitoneum (n = 11), lymph node (n = 9), abdomen (n = 8), mediastinum (n = 6), or other site (n = 4); and lymphoma subtypes were indolent B-cell (n = 20; 2 small lymphocytic, 14 follicle center, 4 not subtyped), aggressive B-cell (n = 14; 3 mantle cell, 10 large cell, 1 not subtyped), B-cell not further specified (n = 2), or Hodgkin disease (n = 2). For the diagnosis of these lymphomas, FC was necessary in 20 cases, useful in 14 cases, not useful in 2 cases, and misleading in 2 cases. Thirty-two of 36 lymphoma patients with follow-up data received antitumor therapy based on the results of NAB plus FC. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive FC of NABs is potentially practicable in a community hospital, is necessary or useful for the diagnosis and subtyping of most B-cell lymphomas, and can help direct lymphoma therapy. Repeated NAB or surgical biopsy is necessary for diagnosis or treatment in some cases.},	keywords={Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antigens, CD19/analysis; Antigens, CD20/analysis; Antigens, CD5/analysis; Biopsy, Needle; Female; Flow Cytometry/methods; Hospitals, Community; Humans; Immunophenotyping; Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/immunology; Male; Middle Aged; Neprilysin/analysis},	isbn={0003-9985},	language={eng}}}@book{RefWorks:137,	author={Silicon Genetics},	year={2003},	title={A Lightweight Interchange Format for Gene Expression Data},	note={ID: 72; RP: NOT IN FILE},	keywords={Gene Expression},	url={http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray/General/Events/Jamboree2003/post_jamboree.html}}}@book{RefWorks:1290,	author={BW Silverman},	year={1986},	title={Density Estimation for Statistics and Data Analysis},	publisher={Chapman & Hall/CRC},	note={ID: 100}}}@misc{RefWorks:261,  author = 	 { Simon},  year = 	 {2002},  title = 	 {Design of studies using DNA microarrays},  journal = 	 {Genetic epidemiology},  volume = 	 {23},  number = 	 {1},  pages = 	 {21},  isbn = 	 {0741-0395}}}@misc{RefWorks:415,	author={Michael Singer},	year={2002},	month={July 19, 2002},	title={JPEG Patent Becoming A Battleground},	volume={2008},	number={03/08}}}@article{RefWorks:1490,	author={Evren Sirin and Bijan Parsia and Bernardo Cuenca Grau and Aditya Kalyanpur and Yarden Katz},	year={2007},	title={Pellet: A practical OWL-DL reasoner},	journal={Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web},	volume={5},	number={2},	pages={51},	note={note: Software Engineering and the Semantic Web},	keywords={Web Ontology Language; Description logics; Tableau Theorem Proving},	isbn={1570-8268},	url={DOI: 10.1016/j.websem.2007.03.004; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B758F-4NF7Y7R-2/2/684715cf5485269b827d65332803523c}}}@article{RefWorks:1472,	author={B.

The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality.

Only when data can be easily exchanged will the entire biological community be able to derive the full benefit from such microarray studies. RESULTS: To this end we have developed three key ingredients towards standardizing the storage and exchange of microarray data. First, we have created a minimal information for the annotation of a microarray experiment (MIAME)-compliant conceptualization of microarray experiments modeled using the unified modeling language (UML) named MAGE-OM (microarray gene expression object model). Second, we have translated MAGE-OM into an XML-based data format, MAGE-ML, to facilitate the exchange of data. Third, some of us are now using MAGE (or its progenitors) in data production settings. Finally, we have developed a freely available software tool kit (MAGE-STK) that eases the integration of MAGE-ML into end users' systems. CONCLUSIONS: MAGE will help microarray data producers and users to exchange information by providing a common platform for data exchange, and MAGE-STK will make the adoption of MAGE easier},	keywords={Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Profiling; methods; Models,Biological; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Programming Languages; Sequence Analysis,DNA; Support,Non-U.S.Gov't; Support,U.S.Gov't,Non-P.H.S},	url={PM:12225585}}}@article{RefWorks:2,	author={P.

In separate experiments, designed to examine the effects of inducing either the G1 cyclin Cln3p or the B-type cyclin Clb2p, we found that the mRNA levels of more than half of these 800 genes respond to one or both of these cyclins.

Gating-ML, an open specification for encoding gating, data transformations and compensation, has been adopted by the ISAC DSTF as a Candidate Recommendation. Gating-ML can facilitate exchange of gating descriptions the same way that FCS facilitated for exchange of raw FCM data. Its adoption will open new collaborative opportunities as well as possibilities for advanced analyses and methods development. The ISAC DSTF is satisfied that the standard addresses the requirements for a gating exchange standard.

These cells self- renewed while producing all of the blood products and were named hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Since then, HSCs have been a tremendous boon to both basic science in understanding cell biology and as therapy in a cancer transplant setting. More recent work has shown that the HSCs, and possibly populations of cells residing in other tissues, have the properties of stem cells and the ability to repopulate nonrelated organs and tissues. This promiscuous repopulation has been termed plasticity and is the center of much research and even more debate. Our laboratory has recently proven that the HSCs meet the requirements of a stem cell by self-renewing and producing all of the blood lineages while concurrently demonstrating their ability to produce nonhematopoietic endothelial cells of blood vessels. This plasticity of the HSCs demonstrates hemangioblast activity, proven by both single cell and serial HSC transplants, and is the focus of this chapter.},	keywords={Animals; Bone Marrow Cells/physiology; Cell Differentiation/physiology; Cell Lineage/physiology; Flow Cytometry/methods; Hematopoiesis/physiology; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology; Mice},	isbn={1543-1894},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:139,	author={R.

Proteomics profiling by 2D gel electrophoresis to the putative identification of differentially expressed proteins by comparison of mass spectrometry results with reference databases, includes many components of sample processing, not just analysis and interpretation, are regularly revisited and updated. In order for such updates and dissemination of data, a suitable data structure is needed. However, there are no such data structures currently available for the storing of data for multiple gels generated through a single proteomic experiments in a single XML file. This paper proposes a data structure based on XML standards to fill the void that exists between data generated by proteomics experiments and storing of data. Results: In order to address the resulting procedural fluidity we have adopted and implemented a data model centered on the concept of annotated gel (AG) as the format for delivery and management of 2D Gel electrophoresis results. An eXtensible Markup Language (XML) schema is proposed to manage, analyze and disseminate annotated 2D Gel electrophoresis results. The structure of AG objects is formally represented using XML, resulting in the definition of the AGML syntax presented here. Conclusion: The proposed schema accommodates data on the electrophoresis results as well as the mass-spectrometry analysis of selected gel spots. A web-based software library is being developed to handle data storage, analysis and graphic representation. Computational tools described will be made available at http://bioinformatics.musc.edu/agml. Our development of AGML provides a simple data structure for storing 2D gel electrophoresis data},	keywords={Proteins; Proteomics; Software; standards},	url={PM:15005801}}}@article{RefWorks:1300,	author={H.

The advantages of flow cytometry are based largely on its ability to analyse, rapidly and simultaneously, multiple cell properties in a quantitative manner. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping is useful in diagnosing lymphoma under the WHO classification system, where lymphoid neoplasms are separated into distinct clinical entities based upon morphology, immunophenotype, genetic abnormalities and clinical features. Flow cytometry can quantify the expression of proteins associated with a good or poor prognosis, detect multidrug resistance, and measure cell proliferation, making it useful in measuring prognostic indicators in lymphoid neoplasia. The unique attributes of flow cytometry therefore make it a valuable technique in the diagnosis and classification of lymphomas as well as the assessment of prognostic markers in lymphoma patients.},	keywords={Flow Cytometry; Humans; Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/immunology/metabolism; Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism; Prognosis},	isbn={1521-6926},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:142,	author={R.

The conceptualization is encoded using the ontology inference layer (OIL), a knowledge representation language that combines the modeling style of frame-based systems with the expressiveness and reasoning power of description logics (DLs). This paper is the second of a pair in this special issue. The first described the core of the OIL language and the need to use ontologies to deliver semantic bioinformatics resources. In this paper, the early stages of building an ontology component of a bioinformatics resource querying application are described. This ontology (TaO) holds the information about molecular biology represented in bioinformatics resources and the bioinformatics tasks performed over these resources. It, therefore, represents the metadata of the resources the application can query. It also manages the terminologies used in constructing the query plans used to retrieve instances from those external resources. The methodology used in this task capitalizes upon features of OIL-The conceptualization afforded by the frame-based view of OIL's syntax; the expressive power and reasoning of the logical formalism; and the ability to encode both handcrafted, hierarchies of concepts, as well as defining concepts in terms of their properties, which can then be used to establish a classification and infer relationships not encoded by the ontologist. This ability forms the basis of the methodology described here: For each portion of the TaO, a basic framework of concepts is asserted by the ontologist. Then, the properties of these concepts are defined by the ontologist and the logic's reasoning power used to reclassify and infer further relationships. This cycle of elaboration and refinement is iterated on each portion of the ontology until a satisfactory ontology has been created},	keywords={Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biology; classification; Computational Biology; Computer Communication Networks; Database Management Systems; Databases,Factual; Decision Support Techniques; Feasibility Studies; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; methods; Models,Theoretical; Molecular Biology; Programming Languages; Science; Semantics; Support,Non-U.S.Gov't},	url={PM:12075668}}}@article{RefWorks:143,	author={R.

The web, as an enabler for interoperability, has been an excellent mechanism for data publication and transportation. Successful exchange and integration of information, however, depends on a shared language for communication (a terminology) and a shared understanding of what the data means (an ontology). Without this kind of understanding, semantic heterogeneity remains a problem for both humans and machines. One means of dealing with heterogeneity in bioinformatics resources is through terminology founded upon an ontology. Bioinformatics resources tend to be rich in human readable and understandable annotation, with each resource using its own terminology. These resources are machine readable, but not machine understandable. Ontologies have a role in increasing this machine understanding, reducing the semantic heterogeneity between resources and thus promoting the flexible and reliable interoperation of bioinformatics resources. This paper describes a solution derived from the semantic web [a machine understandable world-wide web (WWW)], the ontology inference layer (OIL), as a solution for semantic bioinformatics resources. The nature of the heterogeneity problems are presented along with a description of how metadata from domain ontologies can be used to alleviate this problem.

This method is applied to two studies on humans. In one study, genes are identified that show differential expression over time in response to in vivo endotoxin administration. By using our method, 7,409 genes are called significant at a 1% false-discovery rate level, whereas several existing approaches fail to identify any genes. In another study, 417 genes are identified at a 10% false-discovery rate level that show expression changing with age in the kidney cortex. Here it is also shown that as many as 47% of the genes change with age in a manner more complex than simple exponential growth or decay.

To increase the throughput of CFC assays, we have optimized methods for stimulating, staining, and acquiring whole blood or PBMC samples in 96-well or 24-well plates. RESULTS: We have developed a protocol for whole blood stimulation and processing in deep-well 24- or 96-well plates, and fresh or cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) stimulation and processing in conventional 96-well round-bottom plates. Samples from both HIV-1-seronegative and HIV-1-seropositive donors were tested. We show that the percent response, staining intensity, and cell recovery are comparable to stimulation and processing in tubes using traditional methods. We also show the equivalence of automated gating templates to manual gating for CFC data analysis. CONCLUSION: When combined with flow cytometry analysis using an automated plate loader and an automated analysis algorithm, these plate-based methods provide a higher throughput platform for CFC, as well as reducing operator-induced variability. These factors will be important for processing the numbers of samples required in large clinical trials, and for epitope mapping of patient responses},	keywords={Algorithms; analysis; Automation; Comparative Study; Cryopreservation; Cytokines; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescent Dyes; Human; immunology; instrumentation; methods; Software; standards; Support,Non-U.S.Gov't; Support,U.S.Gov't,P.H.S; T-Lymphocytes; Time Factors},	url={PM:12952557}}}@article{RefWorks:19,	author={P.

To illustrate the value of such analysis, the approach is applied to hematopoietic differentiation in four well studied models (HL-60, U937, Jurkat, and NB4 cells). Expression patterns of some 6,000 human genes were assayed, and an online database was created.

This paper describes the processes and principles underpinning the development of these modules; discusses the ramifications for various interest groups such as experimentalists, funders, publishers and the private sector; addresses the issue of overlap with other reporting guidelines; and highlights the criticality of appropriate tools and resources in enabling 'MIAPE-compliant' reporting.},	keywords={Databases, Protein/standards; Gene Expression Profiling/standards; Genome, Human/genetics; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval/standards; Internationality; Proteomics/standards; Research/standards},	isbn={1087-0156},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:357,	author={ChrisF Taylor},	year={2007},	month={7},	title={Standards for reporting bioscience data: a forward look},	journal={Drug Discovery Today,},	volume={12},	number={13-14},	pages={527-533},	abstract={Groups representing a number of domains in the life sciences have been developing specifications and resources for the description and transmission of data, including those produced by (high-throughput) omics technologies.

In nine individuals there was no apparent underlying disease whereas the remaining displayed a wide range of unrelated diseases. Analysis of the cell surface immunophenotype showed that all individuals express high densities of CD2, CD3, CD5, and TCR alpha/beta on their CD4+ CD8+ subset. On the contrary, these cells did not express CD25, CD38, CD71, HLA-DR, and the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (p75) but expressed high density of CD29 and low density or absence of CD7. CD8 was "dim" in most individuals and consisted only of the CD8 alpha chain isoform. These individuals could be further divided into two subgroups based on the following parameters: in eleven cases CD4+ CD8+ cells had an LGL morphology and expressed the CD11b, CD56 and CD57 NK-associated antigens; in addition, a high percentage of CD4+ CD8- cells from the same individuals also expressed NK-associated antigens on their cell surface (subgroup A). The CD4+ CD8+ cells of the remaining individuals had small lymphocyte morphology, expressed little or no CD11b and CD56 and their CD4+ CD8- cells did not express NK-associated antigens at all (subgroup B). Finally, CD8 was "bright" on the CD4+ CD8+ cells of three individuals and in these cells also the CD8 beta chain isoform was present (subgroup C). Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA with a T-cell receptor beta probe revealed that of the sixteen individuals examined four had a monoclonal, seven an oligoclonal, and five a polyclonal molecular configuration.

Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data. RESULTS: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1--20% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.},	keywords={Algorithms; Cell Cycle/genetics; Cluster Analysis; Comparative Study; Data Display; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Gene Expression; Mathematical Computing; Multigene Family; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/statistics &amp; numerical data; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software},	isbn={1367-4803},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:309,	author={J.

For example, introduction of a 6-8 multiparameter FACS instrument resulted in significant advances in understanding B-cell development. In this chapter, we describe 11-color high-dimensional (Hi-D) FACS staining and data analysis methods that provide greater clarity in identifying the B-cell subsets in bone marrow, spleen, and peritoneal cavity. Further, we show how a single Hi-D FACS antibody reagent combination is sufficient to unambiguously identify most of the currently defined B-cell developmental subsets in the bone marrow (Hardy fractions A-F) and the functional B-cell subsets (B-1a, B-1b, B-2, and marginal zone [MZ] B cells) in the periphery. Although we focus on murine B-cell subsets, the methods we discuss are relevant to FACS studies conducted with all types of cells and other FACS instruments. We introduce a new method for scaling axes for histograms or contour plots of FACS data. This method, which we refer to as Logicle visualization, is particularly useful in promoting correct interpretations of fluorescence-compensated FACS data and visual confirmation of correct compensation values. In addition, it facilitates discrimination of valid subsets. Application of Logicle visualization tools in the Hi-D FACS studies discussed here creates a strong new base for in-depth analysis of B-cell development and function.},	keywords={Animals; B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/immunology; Bone Marrow/immunology; Cell Separation/methods; Flow Cytometry; Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology; Immunophenotyping/methods; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Software; Spleen/cytology/immunology},	isbn={1064-3745},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:310,	author={J.

In this chapter, we discuss High-Definition (Hi-D) FACS methods that can improve analysis of lymphocyte subsets in mouse and man. We focus on the reasons why fluorescence compensation, which is necessary to correct for spectral overlap between two or more fluorochromes used in the same staining combination, is best done as a computed transformation rather than using the analog circuitry available on many flow cytometers. In addition, we introduce a new data visualization method that scales the axes on histograms and two-dimensional contour (or dot) plots to enable visualization of signals from all cells, including those that have minimal fluorescence values and are not properly represented with traditional logarithmic axes. This "Logicle" visualization method, we show, provides superior representations of compensated data and makes correctly compensated data look correct.

However such analyses are often compromised due to problems interpreting changes in ligand binding where the receptor expression is not constant. Commonly, problems are encountered due to cell treatments resulting in altered receptor expression levels, or when cell lines expressing a transfected receptor with variable expression are being compared. To overcome this limitation we have developed a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that aims to automatically and effectively simplify flow cytometric data and perform statistical tests in order to provide a clearer graphical representation of results. RESULTS: To demonstrate the use and advantages of this new spreadsheet method we have investigated the binding of the transmembrane adhesion receptor CD44 to its ligand hyaluronan. In the first example, phorbol ester treatment of cells results in both increased CD44 expression and increased hyaluronan binding. By applying the spreadsheet method we effectively demonstrate that this increased ligand binding results from receptor activation. In the second example we have compared AKR1 cells transfected either with wild type CD44 (WT CD44) or a mutant with a truncated cytoplasmic domain (CD44-T). These two populations do not have equivalent receptor expression levels but by using the spreadsheet method hyaluronan binding could be compared without the need to generate single cell clones or FACS sorting the cells for matching CD44 expression. By this method it was demonstrated that hyaluronan binding requires a threshold expression of CD44 and that this threshold is higher for CD44-T. However, at high CD44-T expression, binding was equivalent to WT CD44 indicating that the cytoplasmic domain has a role in presenting the receptor at the cell surface in a form required for efficient hyaluronan binding rather than modulating receptor activity. CONCLUSION: Using the attached spreadsheets and instructions, a simple post-acquisition method for analysing bivariate flow cytometry data is provided. This method constitutes a straightforward improvement over the standard graphical output of flow cytometric data and has the significant advantage that ligand binding can be compared between cell populations irrespective of receptor expression levels},	keywords={analysis; Animals; Antigens,CD44; Cell Line,Tumor; Flow Cytometry; genetics; Hyaluronic Acid; Ligands; metabolism; methods; Mice; Receptors,Cell Surface; Software; Support,Non-U.S.Gov't; Transfection},	url={PM:15035676}}}@misc{RefWorks:284,	author={United States National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health},	title={           Medical Subject Headings},	volume={2007},	number={01/07}}}@article{RefWorks:1463,	author={GK Valet and G.

The immunophenotype list mode files were exhaustively evaluated by combined lymphocyte, monocyte, and granulocyte (LMG) analysis. The results were introduced into databases and automatically classified in a standardized way. The resulting triple matrix classifiers are laboratory and instrument independent, error tolerant, and robust in the classification of unknown test samples. Practically 100% correct individual patient classification was achievable, and most manually unclassifiable patients were unambiguously classified. It is of interest that the single lambda/CD19/5 antibody triplet provided practically the same information as the full set of the five antibody triplets. This demonstrates that standardized classification can be used to optimize immunophenotype panels. On-line classification of test samples is accessible on the Internet: http://www.biochem.mpg.de/valet/leukaem1.html Immunophenotype panels are usually devised for the detection of the frequency of abnormal cell populations. As shown by computer classification, most the highly discriminant information is, however, not contained in percentage frequency values of cell populations, but rather in total antibody binding, antibody binding ratios, and relative antibody surface density parameters of various lymphocyte, monocyte, and granulocyte cell populations.},	keywords={Antibodies/immunology; Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Bone Marrow Cells/immunology; Computer Communication Networks; Databases, Factual; Flow Cytometry; Granulocytes/immunology; Humans; Immunophenotyping; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/immunology; Lymphocytes/immunology; Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/immunology; Monocytes/immunology},	isbn={0196-4763},	language={eng}}}@book{RefWorks:1297,	author={V.

Input are eight list mode data files acquired with a FACScan flow cytometer. For each cell, four parameters are measured: forward light scatter, orthogonal light scatter, fluorescein fluorescence, and phycoerythrin fluorescence. Eight data files are acquired in the following sequence: unstained, isotype controls, CD10/CD19, CD20/CD5, CD3/CD22, CD7/CD33, HLADR/CD13, and CD34/CD38. First, each of the data files 3 to 8 are clustered independently employing an algorithm based on nearest neighbors. Next, the clusters are associated across the data files to form cell populations, using the assumption of light scatter invariance across tubes for each population. The mean positions of each cell population are fed into a decision tree. The decision tree first identifies normal cell populations, i.e., monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, NK cells, T-lymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes. After elimination of the normal cell populations from the data space, the residual cell populations are classified as B-lineage ALL, T-lineage ALL, AML, AUL, B-CLL, or unknown. The effectiveness of this novel approach is shown with case studies of B-lymphoid, T-lymphoid, and Myeloid acute leukemias.},	keywords={Antigens, CD/analysis; Antigens, CD20; Antigens, CD3/analysis; Antigens, CD34; Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis; B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology; Cell Separation; Eosinophils/pathology; Flow Cytometry/methods; HLA-DR Antigens/analysis; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Immunohistochemistry/methods; Killer Cells, Natural/pathology; Leukemia, B-Cell, Acute/pathology; Leukemia, Myelocytic, Acute/pathology; Leukemia, T-Cell, Acute/pathology; Monocytes/pathology; Neprilysin/analysis; Neutrophils/pathology; T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology},	isbn={0196-4763},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:166,	author={J.

Flow cytometry exhibits three unique technical properties of high potential to study the microbiology of aquatic systems: (i) its tremendous velocity to obtain and process data; (ii) the sorting capacity of some cytometers, which allows the transfer of specific populations or even single cells to a determined location, thus allowing further physical, chemical, biological or molecular analysis; and (iii) high-speed multiparametric data acquisition and multivariate data analysis. Flow cytometry is now commonly used in aquatic microbiology, although the application of cell sorting to microbial ecology and quantification of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and viruses is still under development. The recent development of laser scanning cytometry also provides a new way to further analyse sorted cells or cells recovered on filter membranes or slides. The main infrastructure limitations of flow cytometry are: cost, need for skilled and well-trained operators, and adequate refrigeration systems for high-powered lasers and cell sorters. The selection and obtaining of the optimal fluorochromes, control microorganisms and validations for a specific application may sometimes be difficult to accomplish.},	keywords={Animals; Bacteria/isolation &amp; purification; Bacterial Physiology; Biodegradation; Esterases/metabolism; Flow Cytometry/trends; Image Cytometry; Membrane Potentials; Nucleic Acid Probes; Oxidoreductases/metabolism; Phytoplankton/isolation &amp; Protozoa/isolation &amp; Viruses/isolation &amp; Water Microbiology},	isbn={0168-6445},	language={eng}}}@misc{RefWorks:348,	author={W3C},	title={XHTML 1.0 - The Extensible HyperText Markup Language (Second Edition)}}}@misc{RefWorks:349,	author={W3C},	title={Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)}}}@misc{RefWorks:350,	author={W3C},	title={XML Schema}}}@misc{RefWorks:364,	author={W3C},	title={W3C Recommendation: Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 Specification, Version 1.0}}}@misc{RefWorks:366,	author={W3C},	title={W3C Recommendation - XML Path Language (XPath), Version 1.0}}}@misc{RefWorks:369,	author={W3C},	title={W3C Recommendation - XSL Transformations (XSLT)}}}@misc{RefWorks:370,	author={W3C},	title={W3C Working Draft - XML Pointer Language (XPointer)}}}@misc{RefWorks:372,	author={W3C},	title={W3C Recommendation - Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Second Edition)}}}@misc{RefWorks:379,	author={W3C},	title={Putting mathematics on the Web with MathML}}}@misc{RefWorks:228,	author={W3C - RDF Core Working Group},	title={Resource Description Framework (RDF)}}}@misc{RefWorks:320,	author={W3C Math Working Group},	year={2003},	month={21 October 2003},	title={Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) Version 2.0 (Second Edition), W3C Recommendation},	volume={2007},	number={07/31}}}@misc{RefWorks:409,	author={W3C Patent Policy Working Group},	year={2004},	month={5 February 2004},	title={W3C Patent Policy, 5 February 2004},	volume={2008},	number={03/08}}}@misc{RefWorks:410,	author={W3C Patent Policy Working Group},	year={2002},	month={26 February 2002},	title={Royalty-Free Patent Policy, W3C Working Draft 26 February 2002},	volume={2008},	number={08/03}}}@article{RefWorks:168,	author={A.

Many distinct types are known to carry predictable prognoses and warrant specific therapy. Distinction between lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, most often made by flow cytometry, is crucially important. Several advances in flow cytometry, including availability of new monoclonal antibodies, improved gating strategies, and multiparameter analytic techniques, have all dramatically improved the utility of flow cytometry in the diagnosis and classification of leukemia. Acute leukemias reflect the pattern of antigen acquisition seen in normal hematopoietic differentiation, yet invariably demonstrate distinct aberrant immunophenotypic features. Detailed understanding of these phenotypic patterns of differentiation, particularly in myeloid leukemia, allows for more precise classification of leukemia than does morphology alone. However, morphologic and differentiation-based classifications of leukemia are limited in their prognostic value; cytogenetics and molecular genetics appear to be most important for identifying entities with distinct prognoses and clinical behavior. Increasingly, many of these genetically distinct subgroups of leukemia have been found to be closely associated with distinct immunophenotypes. For example, translocations such as t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and t(1;19) and t(12;21) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have distinctive immunophenotypic profiles. Thus, in addition to classification into differentiation-based subtypes, detailed flow cytometric studies can define complex antigenic profiles that are associated with specific molecular defects and well-defined biology. In summary, multiparameter flow cytometry is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis, classification, and monitoring of patients with acute leukemia.

Overall, 46 +/- 5% (95% confidence interval) developed clinical grade II-IV acute GVHD following transplantation. In univariate analysis, patient or donor age greater than or equal to 18 years was significantly associated with increased GVHD risks (greater than or equal to 18, 63 +/- 6% grade II-IV GVHD vs. less than 18, 27 +/- 6%, P less than .0001), without incremental risk in older adults. Univariate analysis showed that donor:recipient sex match and female:female transplants were associated with less-frequent GVHD. More frequent GVHD was associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia, cytomegalovirus seropositivity, and prior donor alloimmunity (pregnancy or transfusion). Additionally, the allele HLA-A26 was associated with increased risk of GVHD (72%, P = .005) while HLA-DR3 was associated with less GVHD (31%, P = .03). Stepwise multivariate analysis confirmed the increased GVHD risks associated with older recipient age, HLA-A26 and donor:recipient gender (not female:female) and the protective effect of HLA-DR3. Similar results were found using the different analytic technique of recursive partition analysis, which identified within the adult population the lowest GVHD risk in female recipients with nonalloimmunized female donors (20%), while other gender combinations had 68% acute GVHD, regardless of donor alloimmunity. In children (less than 18 years), lower GVHD risk accompanied donor:recipient sex-matched (18%) versus mismatched (33%) BMT. Clinical trials undertaken to lessen the hazards of GVHD must be designed with appropriate attention to these reproducibly identified clinical variables associated with different GVHD risks.},	keywords={Age Factors; Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects; Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention &amp; control; HLA Antigens/analysis; Histocompatibility; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Regression Analysis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Risk Factors; Sex Factors},	isbn={0041-1337},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:253,	author={Daniel J.

Weekly skin, gut, and liver clinical staging; clinically verified differential diagnosis; biopsy information; cyclosporine levels; and initiation of treatment were reviewed and graded according to the consensus GVHD grading method modified by a prospectively determined grading algorithm that specified liver and gut downstaging if a differential diagnosis in that organ was identified. Transplant center (TC) determination of maximum grade was compared with the algorithm-calculated grade and the final expert PR. Of 404 patients reviewed, the TC grade concurred with the calculated algorithm grade in 72% (the algorithm upgraded 18% and downgraded 10%), whereas the TC grade agreed with the PR in 77% (the PR upgraded 12% and downgraded 11%). The calculated algorithm grade was nearly fully (92%) concordant with the final PR grade (the PR upgraded 0.7% and downgraded 7%). Blinded, duplicate reviews for quality control (n = 108) agreed with the initial review in 89% of cases. Algorithm and/or PR review reduced the TC-reported incidence of grade II (28% to 23%) and increased grade III (11% to 20%), whereas grade 0 (41% to 42%), grade I (13% to 12%), and grade IV (7% to 6%) were invariant. Recalculation of the algorithm grading without differential diagnosis downstaging reduced agreement with the TC to a small extent. The original algorithm changed 51 (13%) of 404 from grade 0 to II into grade III or IV or vice versa; calculation without the downgrade modified 44 cases (11%). Maximum acute GVHD grade had a major effect on 2-year disease-free survival, but assignment by TC, calculated algorithm, or final PR grade had little effect on survival within grades or grade categories 0 through II versus III or IV. We conclude that detailed and expert PR yields GVHD scoring that is internally consistent and reproducible with 89% concordance. Weekly recording of GVHD stage along with a calculated grading algorithm acknowledging differential diagnoses results in a final and maximum grade nearly fully concordant with the expert blinded PR. Multicenter prospective GVHD scoring using all available weekly staging and differential diagnosis data can be reliably assessed with a clinically relevant algorithm. This approach can thereby reduce investigator bias, facilitate comparison between centers, and perhaps eliminate the need for an expert PR. This technique should be used in future prospective studies of GVHD prophylaxis. [Journal Article; In English; United States; MEDLINE]}}}@article{RefWorks:402,	author={C. L. Wellington and R. R.

METHODS: From September 1988 through December 1996, 294 patients with Stage I-IV Working Formulation large B-cell or T-cell lymphomas were treated prospectively on two protocols at our center. Diagnoses were reclassified subsequently according to the new World Health Organization classification. Two-hundred and twenty-four patients had DLBCL, including 24 patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment consisted of a median of six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy with or without involved-field radiotherapy (median dose, 39.6 Gy). RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The median length of follow-up among surviving patients was 5.0 years. Patient subgroups differed from each other in terms of progression-free (P = 0.003), cause-specific (P = 0.003), and overall (P = 0.001) survival rates when analyzed by IPI. Five-year progression-free, cause-specific, and overall survival rates for 212 patients with an IPI of 0-2 were 73%, 84%, and 82%, respectively, versus only 37%, 33%, and 32% for 12 patients with an IPI of 3-4. To improve our results, we are conducting clinical trials with young DLBCL patients and with patients who are older than 60 years. The young DLBCL patients, who have more than two adverse prognostic features, are receiving high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue. The patients who are older than 60 years, regardless of IPI, are receiving rituximab immunotherapy and liposomal CHOP chemotherapy with or without involved-field radiotherapy.},	keywords={Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage; Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage; Doxorubicin/administration & dosage; Female; Humans; Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/mortality; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/mortality; Male; Middle Aged; Prednisone/administration & dosage; Prognosis; Survival Rate; Vincristine/administration & dosage},	isbn={0008-543X},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:158,	author={H.

To determine the prognostic significance of this marker when rituximab (R) was added to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy, we prospectively studied Bcl-6 protein expression by immunohistochemical staining of 199 paraffin-embedded specimens from patients enrolled in the US Intergroup phase 3 trial comparing R-CHOP to CHOP with or without maintenance R. In Bcl-6(-) patients, failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) were prolonged for those treated with R-CHOP alone compared to CHOP alone (2-year FFS 76% versus 9%, P < .001; 2-year OS 79% versus 17%, P < .001). In contrast, no differences in FFS and OS were detected between treatment arms for Bcl-6(+) cases. In the multivariate analysis, treatment arm (CHOP versus R-CHOP) was the major determinant of both FFS (P < .001) and OS (P < .001) for the Bcl-6(-) subset, whereas the International Prognostic Index risk group was the only significant predictor of outcome among Bcl-6(+) cases. Bcl-2 protein expression was not predictive of outcome in either group. In this study, we observed a reduction in treatment failures and death with the addition of R to CHOP in Bcl-6(-) DLBCL cases only. Our finding that Bcl-6(+) cases did not benefit from the addition of R to CHOP requires independent confirmation.},	keywords={Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage; DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/deficiency; Doxorubicin/administration & dosage; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality; Male; Middle Aged; Prednisone/administration & dosage; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Survival Rate; Treatment Failure; Vincristine/administration & dosage},	isbn={0006-4971},	language={eng}}}@misc{RefWorks:408,	author={World Intellectual Property Organization},	title={Standards and Patents},	volume={2008},	number={03/08}}}@misc{RefWorks:159,	author={World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)},	year={2004},	month={02/10/},	title={OWL Web Ontology Language Guide},	journal={http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/},}}@misc{RefWorks:227,	author={World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)},	title={Extensible Markup Language (XML)}}}@misc{RefWorks:229,	author={World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)},	title={RDF Primer},	journal={: ,}}}@misc{RefWorks:231,	author={World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)},	title={OWL Web Ontology Language Reference}}}@misc{RefWorks:238,	author={World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)},	title={Report on XML Packaging}}}@misc{RefWorks:242,	author={World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)},	title={XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes}}}@misc{RefWorks:360,	author={World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)},	title={XML Schema Part 0: Primer Second Edition}}}@misc{RefWorks:361,	author={World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)},	title={XML Schema Part 1: Structures Second Edition}}}@article{RefWorks:1327,	author={G.

The prognostic value of various clinical and biological factors in predicting treatment outcome is discussed in this paper. A review of the English literature was performed including original articles and relevant reviews from MEDLINE that addressed the topics of DLBCL biology and potential prognostic factors. The International Prognostic Index is, to date, the most successful clinical model for predicting outcome. In addition, a rapidly expanding list of molecules has been identified by conventional and newer diagnostic methods that may be of significant prognostic value. Gene expression profiling has led to the discovery of new biological subtypes of DLBCL based on patterns of gene expression, and a host of new genes that may play important roles in this disease. Various derangements in apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation, differentiation, and signal transduction have been noted, while the host environment and immune response also appear to modify clinical outcome. Although to our knowledge, the fundamental abnormalities underlying DLBCL remain elusive, progress is being continuously made to further the understanding of the biological heterogeneity of this disease and the use of various clinical and biological variables to predict treatment outcome. The goal is to be able to identify subgroups of patients at high risk of treatment failure and develop more effective treatment based on specific biological defects that may represent new rational therapeutic targets.},	keywords={Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology/therapy; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/pathology/therapy; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Markers, Biological/analysis/genetics},	isbn={0008-543X},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1316,	author={ Xu},	year={2002},	title={Comparison of multiparameter flow cytometry with cluster analysis and immunohistochemistry for the detection of CD10 in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas},	journal={Modern pathology},	volume={15},	number={4},	pages={413},	isbn={0893-3952}}}@article{RefWorks:24,	author={X.

Here we introduce a regression-based statistical modeling approach that identifies differentially expressed genes in microarray time-course studies. To illustrate this method, we applied it to data generated from an inducible Huntington's disease transgenic model. The regression method accounts for the induction process, incorporates relevant experimental information, and includes parameters that specifically address the research interest: the temporal differences in gene expression profiles between the mutant and control mice over the time course, in addition to heterogeneities that commonly exist in microarray data. Least-squares and estimating equation techniques were used to estimate parameters and variances, and inferences were made based on efficient and robust Z-statistics under a set of well-defined assumptions. A permutation test was also used to estimate the number of false-positives, providing an alternative measurement of statistical significance useful for investigators to make decisions on follow-up studies.},	keywords={Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology; Computational Biology; Corpus Striatum/drug effects/metabolism; Doxycycline/pharmacology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Huntington Disease/genetics; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Models, Genetic; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Peptides/genetics/metabolism; Proteins/genetics/metabolism; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Regression Analysis; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Time Factors},	isbn={0964-6906},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:263,	author={Qing T.

The approach is unrestricted with respect to the timing, magnitude or duration of the response, or the overall abundance of the transcript. The statistical model makes an accommodation for systematic heterogeneity in expression levels. Corresponding data analyses provide gene-specific information, and the approach provides a means for evaluating the statistical significance of such information. To illustrate this strategy we have derived a model to depict the profile expected for a periodically transcribed gene and used it to look for budding yeast transcripts that adhere to this profile. Using objective criteria, this method identifies 81% of the known periodic transcripts and 1,088 genes, which show significant periodicity in at least one of the three data sets analyzed. However, only one-quarter of these genes show significant oscillations in at least two data sets and can be classified as periodic with high confidence. The method provides estimates of the mean activation and deactivation times, induced and basal expression levels, and statistical measures of the precision of these estimates for each periodic transcript.},	keywords={CDC28 Protein Kinase, S cerevisiae/genetics; Cell Cycle/genetics; Models, Statistical; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; RNA, Messenger/genetics; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Transcription, Genetic},	isbn={0027-8424},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:4,	author={G.

Some of these form clusters of co-regulated genes. The 'CLB2' cluster contains 33 genes whose transcription peaks early in mitosis, including CLB1, CLB2, SWI5, ACE2, CDC5, CDC20 and other genes important for mitosis. Here we find that the genes in this cluster lose their cell cycle regulation in a mutant that lacks two forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2. Fkh2 protein is associated with the promoters of CLB2, SWI5 and other genes of the cluster. These results indicate that Fkh proteins are transcription factors for the CLB2 cluster. The fkh1 fkh2 mutant also displays aberrant regulation of the 'SIC1' cluster, whose member genes are expressed in the M-G1 interval and are involved in mitotic exit. This aberrant regulation may be due to aberrant expression of the transcription factors Swi5 and Ace2, which are members of the CLB2 cluster and controllers of the SIC1 cluster. Thus, a cascade of transcription factors operates late in the cell cycle. Finally, the fkh1 fkh2 mutant displays a constitutive pseudohyphal morphology, indicating that Fkh1 and Fkh2 may help control the switch to this mode of growth.},	keywords={Binding Sites; Cyclin B/genetics; DNA, Fungal/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Genes, cdc; Multigene Family; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins/genetics; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Precipitin Tests; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein Binding; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/growth &amp; development; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors/genetics},	isbn={0028-0836},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1346,	author={M.

Contrary to this conventional division, there is considerable evidence that significant numbers of CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) lymphocytes exist in the peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid tissues of swine, chickens and monkeys. Although CD4/CD8 DP T cells are rarely present in human peripheral blood the relative percentage of this lymphocyte population can increase spontaneously in healthy individuals and in persons suffering from certain disease conditions. DP can also be found among those T cells infiltrating arthritic joints, rejected kidney grafts and certain tumors. In humans, and rats, CD4/CD8 DP T cells appear transiently following activation of their progenitors. Murine DP cells have been described as a subset of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). However, the relationship of IELs to DP cells in the peripheral blood of other species is unknown. Because of their unconventional phenotype and rarity in human and mice, most immunologists have ignored extrathymic CD4/CD8 DP lymphocytes. Nevertheless, their abundance in the peripheral blood of swine, monkeys and chickens makes it impossible to dismiss this lymphocyte population. Here are reports that have described extrathymic lymphocytes exhibiting a CD4+CD8dim phenotype in several species reviewed. Swine and monkey lymphocytes with this phenotype are represented by small resting cells that simultaneously express CD4 and CD8alpha molecules. The available evidence favors the notion that such DP T cells in swine are comprised predominantly of MHC class II restricted memory CD4+ helper T cells that after activation have acquired the ability to express the CD8alpha chain and then to maintain this DP phenotype. Moreover, porcine CD4/CD8 DP T cells appear to be comprised of memory cells due to their ability to respond to recall antigen, resilience to thymectomy, increase in proportion with age, expression of memory T cell markers, production of interferon-gamma and localization to inflammatory sites. Some of these characteristics are also descriptive of human and monkey CD4/CD8 DP T cells. Thus, in swine, humans and monkeys, these phenotypically distinct lymphocytes appear to represent a primed T cell subset. The possible functional significance of the simultaneous expression of the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors on mature T cells is discussed.},	keywords={Animals; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology; Chickens; Haplorhini; Humans; Lymphoid Tissue/immunology; Mice; Rats; Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/immunology; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Swine; T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology},	isbn={0165-2427 (Print)},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1441,

Current data standards do not capture the full scope of FCM experiments and there is a demand for software tools that can assist in the exploration and analysis of large FCM datasets. We are implementing a standardized approach to capturing, analyzing, and disseminating FCM data that will facilitate both more complex analyses and analysis of datasets that could not previously be efficiently studied. Initial work has focused on developing a community-based guideline for recording and reporting the details of FCM experiments. Open source software tools that implement this standard are being created, with an emphasis on facilitating reproducible and extensible data analyses. As well, tools for electronic collaboration will assist the integrated access and comprehension of experiments to empower users to collaborate on FCM analyses. This coordinated, joint development of bioinformatics standards and software tools for FCM data analysis has the potential to greatly facilitate both basic and clinical research--impacting a notably diverse range of medical and environmental research areas.},

Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005-2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered.},

We neglect, often to our cost, the curation and cataloguing of the processes that we use to integrate and analyse our data. Programmatic access to services, for data and processes, means that compositions of services can be made that represent the in silico experiments or processes that bioinformaticians perform. Data integration through workflows depends on being able to know what services exist and where to find those services. The large number of services and the operations they perform, their arbitrary naming and lack of documentation, however, mean that they can be difficult to use. The workflows themselves are composite processes that could be pooled and reused but only if they too can be found and understood. Thus appropriate curation, including semantic mark-up, would enable processes to be found, maintained and consequently used more easily. This broader view on semantic annotation is vital for full data integration that is necessary for the modern scientific analyses in biology. This article will brief the community on the current state of the art and the current challenges for process curation, both within and without the Life Sciences.},	keywords={Computational Biology; Database Management Systems; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval/methods; Programming Languages; Reproducibility of Results; Semantics; Software; Systems Integration; User-Computer Interface},	isbn={1477-4054},	language={eng}}}@article{RefWorks:1510,	author={S.

In addition, the complex biological data stored in bioinformatics databases often require the addition of knowledge to specify and constrain the values held in that database. One way of capturing knowledge within bioinformatics applications and databases is the use of ontologies.An ontology is the concrete form of a conceptualisation of a community's knowledge of a domain. This paper aims to introduce the reader to the use of ontologies within bioinformatics. A description of the type of knowledge held in an ontology will be given.The paper will be illustrated throughout with examples taken from bioinformatics and molecular biology, and a survey of current biological ontologies will be presented. From this it will be seen that the use to which the ontology is put largely determines the content of the ontology. Finally, the paper will describe the process of building an ontology, introducing the reader to the techniques and methods currently in use and the open research questions in ontology development.},	keywords={Artificial Intelligence; Classification; Computational Biology; Databases, Factual; Developmental Biology/statistics & numerical data; Molecular Biology/statistics & numerical data; Software},	isbn={1467-5463},	language={eng}}}

	abstract={Hundreds of researchers across the world use the Stanford Microarray Database (SMD; http://smd.stanford.edu/) to store, annotate, view, analyze and share microarray data. In addition to providing registered users at Stanford access to their own data, SMD also provides access to public data, and tools with which to analyze those data, to any public user anywhere in the world. Previously, the addition of new microarray data analysis tools to SMD has been limited by available engineering resources, and in addition, the existing suite of tools did not provide a simple way to design, execute and share analysis pipelines, or to document such pipelines for the purposes of publication. To address this, we have incorporated the GenePattern software package directly into SMD, providing access to many new analysis tools, as well as a plug-in architecture that allows users to directly integrate and share additional tools through SMD. In this article, we describe our implementation of the GenePattern microarray analysis software package into the SMD code base. This extension is available with the SMD source code that is fully and freely available to others under an Open Source license, enabling other groups to create a local installation of SMD with an enriched data analysis capability.},

	journal={Journal of Biomedical Informatics},
	volume={41},
	number={5},
	pages={706-716},
	abstract={Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format for the web, these databases are still available in various formats. With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several of NCBI's databases can now be made available in RDF format through a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

	title={Moby and Moby 2: Creatures of the Deep (Web)},
	journal={Briefings in bioinformatics},
	abstract={Facile and meaningful integration of data from disparate resources is the 'holy grail' of bioinformatics. Some resources have begun to address this problem by providing their data using Semantic Web standards, specifically the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Unfortunately, adoption of Semantic Web standards has been slow overall, and even in cases where the standards are being utilized, interconnectivity between resources is rare. In response, we have seen the emergence of centralized 'semantic warehouses' that collect public data from third parties, integrate it, translate it into OWL/RDF and provide it to the community as a unified and queryable resource. One limitation of the warehouse approach is that queries are confined to the resources that have been selected for inclusion. A related problem, perhaps of greater concern, is that the majority of bioinformatics data exists in the 'Deep Web'-that is, the data does not exist until an application or analytical tool is invoked, and therefore does not have a predictable Web address. The inability to utilize Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to address this data is a barrier to its accessibility via URI-centric Semantic Web technologies. Here we examine 'The State of the Union' for the adoption of Semantic Web standards in the health care and life sciences domain by key bioinformatics resources, explore the nature and connectivity of several community-driven semantic warehousing projects, and report on our own progress with the CardioSHARE/Moby-2 project, which aims to make the resources of the Deep Web transparently accessible through SPARQL queries.},

	journal={Structure (London, England : 1993)},
	volume={5},
	number={8},
	pages={1093-1108},
	abstract={BACKGROUND: Protein evolution gives rise to families of structurally related proteins, within which sequence identities can be extremely low. As a result, structure-based classifications can be effective at identifying unanticipated relationships in known structures and in optimal cases function can also be assigned. The ever increasing number of known protein structures is too large to classify all proteins manually, therefore, automatic methods are needed for fast evaluation of protein structures. RESULTS: We present a semi-automatic procedure for deriving a novel hierarchical classification of protein domain structures (CATH). The four main levels of our classification are protein class (C), architecture (A), topology (T) and homologous superfamily (H). Class is the simplest level, and it essentially describes the secondary structure composition of each domain. In contrast, architecture summarises the shape revealed by the orientations of the secondary structure units, such as barrels and sandwiches. At the topology level, sequential connectivity is considered, such that members of the same architecture might have quite different topologies. When structures belonging to the same T-level have suitably high similarities combined with similar functions, the proteins are assumed to be evolutionarily related and put into the same homologous superfamily. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the structural families generated by CATH reveals the prominent features of protein structure space. We find that nearly a third of the homologous superfamilies (H-levels) belong to ten major T-levels, which we call superfolds, and furthermore that nearly two-thirds of these H-levels cluster into nine simple architectures. A database of well-characterised protein structure families, such as CATH, will facilitate the assignment of structure-function/evolution relationships to both known and newly determined protein structures.},

	abstract={KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the GENES database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).},

The quantity of publicly available data is still relatively modest due to a lack of community accepted data standards, tools to facilitate the data sharing process and controlled vocabularies to ensure that consistent terminology is used to describe the experimental methodology. It is becoming widely recognised that there are significant benefits in data sharing for proteomics, allowing results to be verified and new findings to be generated by re-analysis of published studies. We report on standards development by the Gel Analysis Workgroup of the Proteomics Standards Initiative. The workgroup develops reporting requirements, data formats and controlled vocabularies for experimental gel electrophoresis, and informatics performed on gel images. We present a tutorial on how such resources can be used and how the community should get involved with the on-going projects. Finally, we present a roadmap for future developments in this area.},

Despite the extensive use of metaclasses in Protege, it proved possible to convert the FMA from Protege into OWL DL, while capturing most of its original features. The conversion relies on a set of translation and enrichment rules implemented with flexible options. Unsurprisingly, reasoning with the FMA in OWL proved to be a real challenge, due to its sheer size and complexity, and raised significant inference problems in terms of time and memory requirements. However, various smaller versions have been successfully handled by Racer. Some inconsistencies were identified and several classes reclassified. The results obtained so far show the advantage of OWL DL over frames and, more generally, the usefulness of DLs reasoners for building and maintaining the large-scale biomedical ontologies of the future Semantic Web.},
