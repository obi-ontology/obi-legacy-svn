from Larisa to Everyone:
Can we have investigations without assays?
from Asiyah Yu Lin to Everyone:
agree with Matthew
from Larisa to Everyone:
it is all correct, but when there is a choice, it should tend to assays
from James Overton to Everyone:
I don't doubt that there are grey areas. :^)
from Philippe to Everyone:
:)
from James Overton to Everyone:
Some sort of linking is absolutely necessary.
from Philippe to Everyone:
and apply the parsimony principle for adding axioms. as more nested one will cause scalability issues in queries (even if one can exploit property path)
from James Overton to Everyone:
"As simple as possible, but no simpler."
from Philippe to Everyone:
exactly.
from Larisa to Everyone:
ok, good
from Larisa to Everyone:
where can I find this table? it would be most useful
from Larisa to Everyone:
i will keep it confedentioal
from Philippe to Everyone:
cell and chemical entity where applicable,+1
from Larisa to Everyone:
but you need to keep the information that cells are from a mouse
from James Overton to Everyone:
I don't think we're disagreeing about the goal, just about some of the details of how to model things.
from Philippe to Everyone:
we should probably hear the query cases from our users
from Philippe to Everyone:
and check that we deliver on the needs
from Philippe to Everyone:
at the moment, it seems we are missing who and when was the assay performed as mentioned by Larissa
from James Overton to Everyone:
I have to go in just a minute. Do I have any action items?
from Larisa to Everyone:
yes, will do
from James Overton to Everyone:
Sounds good. I'll look further into IEDB examples.
