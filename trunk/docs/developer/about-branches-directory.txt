====== README file for OBI branches directory =====

This directory contains several files, amongst which:

- obi.owl is the official OBI file which in turn imports all other
  branch files and external ontologies as required.

- obil.owl is the OBI Local version of obi.owl. It is used for lisp
  scripting and development, which doesn't have the same .repository
  mechanism that protege uses, and instead uses relative paths to
  physically find the branch files.

- obid.owl is the OBI Disjoints version of obi.owl. It consists of
  obil.owl importing the disjoints.owl file.

- obidi.owl is the OBI Disjoints and Individuals file. It consists of
  obid.owl importing the assumed-individuals.owl file.

*How to produce the disjoint.owl file

You need to use the add-disjoints.lisp script (in obi/trunk/src/tools/build).

Using lsw, start abcl, load obi.asd and then execute

(write-disjoints (load-kb-jena "obi.owl") "~/Desktop/disjoints.owl")

where obi.owl is the merged file (e.g. the latest obi.owl released
file, available at http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi.owl) and
~/Desktop/disjoints.owl is where to write the resulting file (i.e. the
one containing the declaration of the disjoints)

*How to produce the assumed-individuals.owl file

You need to use the add-assumed-individuals.lisp script (in
obi/trunk/src/tools/build). Using lsw, start abcl. In we assume your 
current directory is the obi trunk.

lib/external/lsw/bin/lsw

When the prompt appears, load the obi lisp tools

(load "src/tools/build/obi.asd")
(asdf::oos 'asdf::load-op :obi)

To create the individuals file based on the current developer version

(write-assumed-individuals (load-kb-jena "src/ontology/branches/obil.owl")
  "~/Desktop/assumed-individuals.owl")

You can use a different file instead of obil.owl. For example the latest obi.owl
released file, can be used instead with:

(write-assumed-individuals (load-kb-jena "http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi.owl")
  "~/Desktop/assumed-individuals.owl")

~/Desktop/assumed-individuals.owl is where the resulting
file (i.e. the one containing the declaration of the individuals) is written.
