This directory contains several files, amongst which:

- obi.owl is the official OBI file which in turn imports all other
  branch files and external ontologies as required.

- obil.owl is the OBI Local version of obi.owl. It is used for lisp
  scripting and development, which doesn't have the same .repository
  mechanism that protege uses, and instead uses relative paths to
  physically find the branch files.

- obid.owl is the OBI Disjoints version of obi.owl. It consists of
  obil.owl importing the disjoints.owl file.

- obidi.owl is the OBI Disjoints and Individuals file. It consists of
  obid.owl importing the assumed-individuals.owl file.


You will use lsw to run the scripts below. You can start up the server with

perl bin/obi-lisp-eval.pl '(print "hello world")'

and shut it down (you should shut it down if you plan no further use
to free up the memory it reserves) with

perl bin/obi-lisp-eval.pl '(quit)'

*How to produce the disjoint.owl file

perl bin/obi-lisp-eval.pl '(write-disjoints (load-kb-jena "http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi.owl") "~/Desktop/disjoints.owl")'

The latest obi.owl released file, available at http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi.owl
is the input here, and ~/Desktop/disjoints.owl is where to write the resulting file
(i.e. the one containing the declaration of the disjoints)

*How to produce the assumed-individuals.owl file

perl bin/obi-lisp-eval.pl '(write-assumed-individuals (load-kb-jena "http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi.owl")  "~/Desktop/assumed-individuals.owl")'

~/Desktop/assumed-individuals.owl is where the resulting
file (i.e. the one containing the declaration of the individuals) is written.

You can use a file: url to use an obi.owl file somewhere in your filesytem.

For example

perl bin/obi-lisp-eval.pl '(write-assumed-individuals (load-kb-jena "file:///Users/alanr/repos/obi/trunk/src/ontology/branches/obil.owl")  "~/Desktop/assumed-individuals.owl")'
