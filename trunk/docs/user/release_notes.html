<h1>OBI Release Notes</h1>

The current version of OBI.owl provided at the site is still a draft.
In fact, it is a pre-release version that is meant for review and could change substantially after review.
The current version however represents the efforts from the different OBI branch development as provided at <a href="http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/tags/releases/">http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/tags/releases/</a> at the date of release.

The release consists in several files:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/2008-04-08/obi.owl">OBI.owl</a><br>The merged file representing the current status of the project, created by merging the branches together.
This file is OWL-DL and consistent. (checked with Pellet 1.5)
<br>
<li><u>OBI-ProtegeFriendly.owl</u><br>
Due to a bug in Protege 3.x, the namespaces are not properly handled in the OWL-DL version.
We therefore produce as a temporary fix a Protege friendly version, wich is consistent but OWL-Full.
This will allow the display via label instead of IDs in Protege 3.x
See instructions on <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dzprnmw_10gk2mcpfb&amp;hl=en">Using Protege with OBI</a>

<li><u>OBI-ProtegeFriendly.pprj</u><br>
As a convenience, we also provide a Protege project file (OBI-ProtegeFriendly.pprj) which will activate the label display in Protege.
To use it, download OBI-ProtegeFriendly.pprj AND OBI-ProtegeFriendly.owl in the same directory. In Protege, choose File, Open, and open the OBI-ProtegeFriendly.pprj project file.
<li><u>md5.txt</u><br>
This file contains an md5 checksum computed from OBI.owl. It is intended as an integrity check of your download, and is the first step towards a versioning control system.
It will most probably be modified in its structure in the following releases.

<li> <a href="http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi/release-notes.html">this file</a>

</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dzprnmw_10gk2mcpfb&amp;hl=en">Using Protege with OBI</a> 
<br>
Some information on how to load OBI into Protege, how to activate label dipslay...
<li> <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dzprnmw_8fnr5nmd4&amp;hl=en">OBI ID policy</a> 
<br>
This document explains our ID policy, and you will also find there some information about the proper way of referencing OBI Terms.
<li> <a href="http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi/report.html">Ontology report</a> 
<br>
This is an HTML report representing OBI as a single HTML file that can be opened directly by any web browser.
</ul>

<h2>Usage of OBI</h2>
<ul>
<li> if you use the <a href="http://purl.obofoundry.org/obi.owl">http://purl.obofoundry.org/obi.owl</a> version
You know that you will always be using the latest version of OBI. The 
drawback is that you delegate the version control of OBI to the OBI 
consortium: OBI will change.

<li> if you use a purl linking to a specific version, e.g. 
<a href="http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/2008-03-10/obi.owl">http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/2008-03-10/obi.owl</a>
You keep total control over the version of OBI you are using. However 
you won't get the latest modifications and updates from OBI.
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<h3>2008-04-08</h3>
<ol>
<li>Some classes asserted under device don't have disjoints (we don't produce disjoints for asserted classes under defined classes)
<li>Some labels haven't been updated to lang="en"
</ol>

<h3>2008-03-10</h3>
<ol>
<li>Some class names use upper case or camel case (e.g. OBI_0000005, 'Conclusion'). Current OBI and obo Foundry policy is not to enforce initial upper case (see <a href="http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/Naming">OBO Foundry Naming</a>), and in general start with a lower case.
<li>The word delimiter in class and property names should be ' ' (space) rather than '_' (underscore). Currently we have a crude mixture, even within single class names, e.g. OBI_0000056, 'Notified_Body role'.
</ol>


<h2>Changelog</h2>

<h3>2008-04-08</h3>
<pre>
- versioning information
We decided to adopt a simple versioning system for the moment. We add in the release script the current version ID from SVN, to get something of the form:
<owl:versionInfo xml:lang="en">1.0.530</owl:versionInfo>

- some checks are performed
We are currently checking that all classes have a label, getting a list of classes which are missing a curation status and the list of classes which are asserted under defined classes. More to come.

- PURLs for our terms
We produce a list of purls that have to be created (and correspond to the classes that have been added in OBI since the previous release).
Work is in progress on producing one HTML page per term (prototype http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/OBO_0000225), which is OWL underneath (view source), but presents as HTML)



</pre>
<h3>2008-03-10</h3>
<pre>
- modified namespaces
We don't want to have any reference to the branches in the merged file, and the merging script removes unused namespaces declarations.
The branches had protege-created prefixes (e.g. p7 for
data_transformation), and we replaced that by uniform namespaces (e.g.
data_trans for data_transformation)

Alan checked in new versions of all the files that should have stable namespaces now.
See sourcecodes/normalize-namespaces.pl

- modified curation status
Bill added the new curation status values to the AnnotationProperty.owl file as an enumeration class.
This brings us into owl-full (declaratio not included in the release which is OWL-DL, but values are - documentation in progress)

- created a protege widget for use of the above described curation_status

- modified svn keyword
We need to define an OBI general policy regarding that. Currently
TheRest.owl contains an old versionInfo, and the obi.owl contained
$Revision:80$ which was a wrong svn:keyword.

Corrected by Bill, general policy added to agenda for next obi-dev call.

- corrected consistency
We needed to do several changes, some classes had been deleted,
deprecated or have had their ID re-assigned and thus relations towards
them were inconsistent.

As per release policy, we will in the future check the files at D-8 and D-3, and email obi-dev with inconsistency problems.

- Protege 3 and label display
We produce 2 versions of the release: OBI.owl is the official file, which is OWL-DL and consistent.

Protege 3 doesn't read properly the Â«owl:Ontology rdf:about.../>
and thus doesn't recognize the proper namespace. This causes problems
when the user wants to display the labels instead of the IDs. The
workaround for that Protege bug causes the file to be classified as
OWL-Full from Pellet, and our requirement for release was to have an
OWL-DL file. We thus decided to provide a second version
Protege-friendly for convenience.

- Added by Chris Mungall on Bill's request in the BFO v1.1 to RO bridge (http://obofoundry.org/ro/ro_bfo1-1_bridge.owl):

  &lt;owl:Class rdf:about="http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/1.1/snap#Continuant"/>

  &lt;owl:Class rdf:about="http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/1.1/span#Occurrent"/>

Pellet isn't able to pass the file as OWL DL, unless these declarations
are included.  Without a BFO import statement, it has no way of knowing
these BFO entities are valid OWL types.

- import of ro_bfo_bridge corrected
Chris Mungall added a version of http://purl.org/obo/owl/ro_bfo_bridge/1.1
under http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies/owl/ro_bfo_bridge/1.1


- modified URIs - added/checked IDs
Alan worked on a script to assign IDs and rewrite the OBI URIs as purl, to comply with the OBI ID policy http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dzprnmw_8fnr5nmd4&amp;amp;hl=en 
See /sourcecodes/modify-uris.pl and sourcecodes/uri-report.lisp

- merging scripts
All scripts under http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~courtot/OBIRelease/ need to be SVN committed.
Melanie will commit the sourcecode, as well as the shell script used to check and generate the release.

- added HTML report
see http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/obi/branchDevelopment/tags/releases/2008-03-10/obi-lsw-report.html 

- added disjoints
Disjoints have been added via script. See http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/branchDevelopment/tags/releases/2008-03-10/sourcecodes/add-disjoints.lisp?view=log
Currently no disjoints have been added for classes below device, which is at the moment asserted under a defined class.

- added an md5 checksum

- normalization of date and versionInfo
We will use the date as version info for now. A general policy on how to version OBI should be discussed.
&lt;owl:versionInfo>2008-03-09&lt;/owl:versionInfo>

&lt;dc:date rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date">2008-03-09&lt;/dc:date>

- creation of SVN tags
A new tag will be created for each release, and will allow users to have stability by importing always the same version.
