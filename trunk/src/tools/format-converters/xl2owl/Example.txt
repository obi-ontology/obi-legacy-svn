OTHER: Adjusted from MGED Ontology						Note that if the word "sum" is replaced by the word "mean" in the definition, the resulting definition is equivalent.			This can be used as a simple normalization method for expression microarray assays.

METHODOLOGY: 65 treatment-naove CHC patients who finished a 24-week therapy with peginterferon (alpha-2b (1.5 mcg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (1000-1200 mg /day) and 24 weeks of follow-up were enrolled. Hepatic fibrosis was graded by the METAVIR scoring system. Serum quantitative HCV RNA was determined by Versant HCV RNA 3.0 assay (Bayer Inc.). RESULTS: Genotype non-1 patients responded quickly and a higher percentage of them achieved undetectable HCV RNA (< 615 IU/mL) at week 4 compared with genotype 1 patients (93% vs. 69%, p = 0.018). Degree of hepatic fibrosis significantly affected end-of-treatment and sustained response (SVR). For patients who did not achieve early virological response (EVR), the negative predictive value for SVR was 100%. In genotype 1 patients, undetectable HCV RNA by week 4 was a good marker to predict treatment response, with a positive predictive value of 84% and a negative predictive value of 82%. CONCLUSIONS: EVR can be applied to Chinese patients as an early stopping rule. A 24-week duration of pegylated IFN/ribavirin might be adequate for genotype 1 patients who rapidly responded to therapy.				stopping rule					PRS

MO_887						MO			PMID: 14744830-Microarrays are powerful tools for surveying the expression levels of many thousands of genes simultaneously. They belong to the new genomics technologies which have important applications in the biological, agricultural and pharmaceutical sciences. There are myriad sources of uncertainty in microarray experiments, and rigorous experimental design is essential for fully realizing the potential of these valuable resources. Two questions frequently asked by biologists on the brink of conducting cDNA or two-colour, spotted microarray experiments are 'Which mRNA samples should be competitively hybridized together on the same slide?' and 'How many times should each slide be replicated?' Early experience has shown that whilst the field of classical experimental design has much to offer this emerging multi-disciplinary area, new approaches which accommodate features specific to the microarray context are needed. In this paper, we propose optimal designs for factorial and time course experiments, which are special designs arising quite frequently in microarray experimentation. Our criterion for optimality is statistical efficiency based on a new notion of admissible designs; our approach enables efficient designs to be selected subject to the information available on the effects of most interest to biologists, the number of arrays available for the experiment, and other resource or practical constraints, including limitations on the amount of mRNA probe. We show that our designs are superior to both the popular reference designs, which are highly inefficient, and to designs incorporating all possible direct pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our proposed designs represent a substantial practical improvement over classical experimental designs which work in terms of standard interactions and main effects. The latter do not provide a basis for meaningful inference on the effects of most interest to biologists, nor make the most efficient use of valuable and limited resources.				time series design					Philippe Rocca-Serra on behalf of MO

Light sources may include one of a variety of lamps (e.g., xenon, halogen, mercury). Most light sources are operated from line power, but some may be powered from batteries. They are mostly used in endoscopic, microscopic, and other examination and/or in surgical procedures. The light source is part of the optical subsystem. In a flow cytometer the light source directs high intensity light at particles at the interogation point. The light source in a flow cytometer is usually a laser.

The lamp consists of two electrodes typically made of tungsten which are separated by a gas. The type of lamp is often named by the gas contained in the bulb; including neon, argon, xenon, krypton, sodium, metal halide, and mercury. The electric arc in an arc lamp consists of gas which is initially ionized by a voltage and is therefore electrically conductive. To start an arc lamp, usually a very high voltage is needed to ignite or strike the arc. This requires an electrical circuit sometimes called an igniter, which is part of a larger circuit called the ballast. The ballast supplies a suitable voltage and current to the lamp as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Older cytometers may use arc lamps to irradiate particles at the interogation point.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_lamp									The Jablochkoff Candle				arc_lamp					John Quinn

OBI_0200116	loess fitting	http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/OBI_0200116	OBI_0200072		http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/OBI_0200072		A loess fitting is a curve fitting obtained by localized regression. The latter refers to fitting a polynomial (straight line, quadratic, cubic, etc) to data values within a window covering a fraction of the total number of observations. As the window slides along the axis, a new polynomial is fit to the observations falling within the window. This continues until all points are fit with a local polynomial. The results are then smoothed together to form a curve. The smoothness of loess fits is controlled by a smoothing parameter (often denoted as alpha, usually between ¼ and 1) and the degree of the polynomial that is fitted by the method (usually denoted by lambda).

However, only 0.9% of these patients have suffered a cervical spine fracture. Current use of radiography is not efficient. The Canadian C-Spine Rule is designed to allow physicians to be more selective and accurate in ordering C-spine radiography, and to rapidly clear the C-spine without the need for radiography in many patients. The goal of this phase III study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an active strategy to implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule into physician practice. Specific objectives are to: 1) determine clinical impact, 2) determine sustainability, 3) evaluate performance, and 4) conduct an economic evaluation. METHODS: We propose a matched-pair cluster design study that compares outcomes during three consecutive 12-months before, after, and decay periods at six pairs of intervention and control sites. These 12 hospital ED sites will be stratified as teaching or community hospitals, matched according to baseline C-spine radiography ordering rates, and then allocated within each pair to either intervention or control groups. During the after period at the intervention sites, simple and inexpensive strategies will be employed to actively implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule. The following outcomes will be assessed: 1) measures of clinical impact, 2) performance of the Canadian C-Spine Rule, and 3) economic measures. During the 12-month decay period, implementation strategies will continue, allowing us to evaluate the sustainability of the effect. We estimate a sample size of 4,800 patients in each period in order to have adequate power to evaluate the main outcomes. DISCUSSION: Phase I successfully derived the Canadian C-Spine Rule and phase II confirmed the accuracy and safety of the rule, hence, the potential for physicians to improve care. What remains unknown is the actual change in clinical behaviors that can be affected by implementation of the Canadian C-Spine Rule, and whether implementation can be achieved with simple and inexpensive measures. We believe that the Canadian C-Spine Rule has the potential to significantly reduce health care costs and improve the efficiency of patient flow in busy Canadian EDs.				matched pairs design					Philippe Rocca-Serra

Equal volumes of target (5 x 10E4 cells/ml) and effector cells were added to triplicate wells of 96-well tissue culture plates, and 1:2 serial dilutions of effectors were made, producing effector-to-target (E:T) ratios of 100:1, 50:1, 25:1, and 12.5:1 (9). Spontaneous release of 51Cr was assessed by the incubation of target cells in medium alone, and maximum release of 51Cr was determined by the incubation of target cells in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich).\nAfter a 4-h incubation of the effector cells with the target cells at 37Â°C in 6% CO2, supernatants were collected following brief centrifugation. The supernatant was collected into filters of supernatant collection system harvesting frames (Molecular Devices Skatron, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and transferred to polystyrene tubes to be counted with the LKB 1272 Clinigamma counter (Wallac).\nPercent specific was determined with the following equation: (experimental 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release)/(maximum 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release) x 100.				chromium release assay					PlanAndPlannedProcess Branch

Adapted from: http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pri/section3/pri3321.htm and						MSI			PMID: 17582121-Our objective was to examine the effects of dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) with different concentrations of dietary crude protein (CP) on performance and acid-base status in early lactation cows. Six lactating Holstein cows averaging 44 d in milk were used in a 6 x 6 Latin square design with a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments: DCAD of -3, 22, or 47 milliequivalents (Na + K - Cl - S)/100 g of dry matter (DM), and 16 or 19% CP on a DM basis. Linear increases with DCAD occurred in DM intake, milk fat percentage, 4% fat-corrected milk production, milk true protein, milk lactose, and milk solids-not-fat. Milk production itself was unaffected by DCAD. Jugular venous blood pH, base excess and HCO3(-) concentration, and urine pH increased, but jugular venous blood Cl- concentration, urine titratable acidity, and net acid excretion decreased linearly with increasing DCAD. An elevated ratio of coccygeal venous plasma essential AA to nonessential AA with increasing DCAD indicated that N metabolism in the rumen was affected, probably resulting in more microbial protein flowing to the small intestine. Cows fed 16% CP had lower urea N in milk than cows fed 19% CP; the same was true for urea N in coccygeal venous plasma and urine. Dry matter intake, milk production, milk composition, and acid-base status did not differ between the 16 and 19% CP treatments. It was concluded that DCAD affected DM intake and performance of dairy cows in early lactation. Feeding 16% dietary CP to cows in early lactation, compared with 19% CP, maintained lactation performance while reducing urea N excretion in milk and urine.				latin square design					Philippe Rocca-Serra

Subjects of a treatment group receive a unique combination of independent variable values making up a treatment		http://www.holah.karoo.net/experimentaldesigns.htm						MSI			PMID: 17408389-Purpose: Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the most important reason for blindness following retinal detachment. Presently, vitreous tamponades such as gas or silicone oil cannot contact the lower part of the retina. A heavier-than-water tamponade displaces the inflammatory and PVR-stimulating environment from the inferior area of the retina. The Heavy Silicone Oil versus Standard Silicone Oil Study (HSO Study) is designed to answer the question of whether a heavier-than-water tamponade improves the prognosis of eyes with PVR of the lower retina. Methods: The HSO Study is a multicentre, randomized, prospective controlled clinical trial comparing two endotamponades within a two-arm parallel group design. Patients with inferiorly and posteriorly located PVR are randomized to either heavy silicone oil or standard silicone oil as a tamponading agent. Three hundred and fifty consecutive patients are recruited per group. After intraoperative re-attachment, patients are randomized to either standard silicone oil (1000 cSt or 5000 cSt) or Densiron((R)) as a tamponading agent. The main endpoint criteria are complete retinal attachment at 12 months and change of visual acuity (VA) 12 months postoperatively compared with the preoperative VA. Secondary endpoints include complete retinal attachment before endotamponade removal, quality of life analysis and the number of retina affecting re-operation within 1 year of follow-up. Results: The design and early recruitment phase of the study are described. Conclusions: The results of this study will uncover whether or not heavy silicone oil improves the prognosis of eyes with PVR.				parallel group design					Philippe Rocca-Serra											independent measure design

Commonly optical subsystems consist of an excitation optics and collection optics. The excitation optics of a flow cytometer optical subsystem consist of the laser and lenses that are used to shape and focus the laser beam. The collections optics consist of a collection lens to collect light emitted from the particle laser beam interaction and a system of optical mirrors and filters to route specified wavelengths of the collected light to designated optical detectors. The optical subsystem in a flow cytometer consists of the equipment used to irradiate particles, and collect the light either emmitted or scattered by those particles.

MO_490						MO			PMID: 17411393-Dye-specific bias effects, commonly observed in the two-color microarray platform, are normally corrected using the dye swap design. This design, however, is relatively expensive and labor-intensive. We propose a self-self hybridization design as an alternative to the dye swap design. In this design, the treated and control samples are labeled with Cy5 and Cy3 (or Cy3 and Cy5), respectively, without dye swap, along with a set of self-self hybridizations on the control sample. We compare this design with the dye swap design through investigation of mouse primary hepatocytes treated with three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) agonists at three dose levels. Using Agilent's Whole Mouse Genome microarray, differentially expressed genes (DEG) were determined for both the self-self hybridization and dye swap designs. The DEG concordance between the two designs was over 80% across each dose treatment and chemical. Furthermore, 90% of DEG-associated biological pathways were in common between the designs, indicating that biological interpretations would be consistent. The reduced labor and expense for the self-self hybridization design make it an efficient substitute for the dye swap design. For example, in larger toxicogenomic studies, only about half the chips are required for the self-self hybridization design compared to that needed in the dye swap design.				self vs self design					Philippe Rocca-Serra on behalf of MO

Each viral particle, or virion, consists of genetic material, DNA or RNA, within a protective protein coat called a capsid. The capsid shape varies from simple helical and icosahedral (polyhedral or near-spherical) forms, to more complex structures with tails or an envelope. Viruses infect cellular life forms and are grouped into animal, plant and bacterial types, according to the type of host infected. Viruses must replicate in a living cell, as they cannot carry out metabolic processes on their own.

This design, however, is relatively expensive and labor-intensive. We propose a self-self hybridization design as an alternative to the dye swap design. In this design, the treated and control samples are labeled with Cy5 and Cy3 (or Cy3 and Cy5), respectively, without dye swap, along with a set of self-self hybridizations on the control sample. We compare this design with the dye swap design through investigation of mouse primary hepatocytes treated with three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) agonists at three dose levels. Using Agilent's Whole Mouse Genome microarray, differentially expressed genes (DEG) were determined for both the self-self hybridization and dye swap designs. The DEG concordance between the two designs was over 80% across each dose treatment and chemical. Furthermore, 90% of DEG-associated biological pathways were in common between the designs, indicating that biological interpretations would be consistent. The reduced labor and expense for the self-self hybridization design make it an efficient substitute for the dye swap design. For example, in larger toxicogenomic studies, only about half the chips are required for the self-self hybridization design compared to that needed in the dye swap design.				dye swap design					Philippe Rocca-Serra on behalf of MO

The number of units per block equals the number of treatment so each block receives each treatment exactly once (hence the qualifier 'complete'). The design was originally devised from field trials used in agronomy and agriculture. The analysis assumes that there is no interaction between block and treatment. The method was then used in other settings So The randomised complete block design is a design in which the subjects are matched according to a variable which the experimenter wishes to control. The subjects are put into groups (blocks) of the same size as the number of treatments. The members of each block are then randomly assigned to different treatment groups.		http://www.tufts.edu/~gdallal/ranblock.htm						MSI			http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/steps/glossary/anova.html,(A researcher is carrying out a study of the effectiveness of four different skin creams for the treatment of a certain skin disease.

In this design, subjects (patients in human context) serve as their own controls, and randomization may be used to determine the ordering which a subject receives the treatment and control		(source: http://www.sbu.se/Filer/Content0/publikationer/1/literaturesearching_1993/glossary.html)						Replace patient or subject (keep track of this in the definition): DONE	MSI		PMID: 17601993-Objective: HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy (HIV-lipodystrophy) are insulin resistant and have elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. We aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying FFA-induced insulin resistance in patients with HIV-lipodystrophy. Research Design and Methods: Using a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design, we studied the effects of an overnight acipimox-induced suppression of FFA on glucose and FFA metabolism by using stable isotope labelled tracer techniques during basal conditions and a two-stage euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp (20 mU insulin/m(2)/min; 50 mU insulin/m(2)/min) in nine patients with nondiabetic HIV-lipodystrophy. All patients received antiretroviral therapy. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained during each stage of the clamp. Results: Acipimox treatment reduced basal FFA rate of appearance by 68.9% (52.6%-79.5%) and decreased plasma FFA concentration by 51.6 % (42.0%-58.9%), (both, P < 0.0001). Endogenous glucose production was not influenced by acipimox. During the clamp the increase in glucose-uptake was significantly greater after acipimox treatment compared to placebo (acipimox: 26.85 (18.09-39.86) vs placebo: 20.30 (13.67-30.13) mumol/kg/min; P < 0.01). Insulin increased phosphorylation of Akt (Thr(308)) and GSK-3beta (Ser(9)), decreased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GS) site 3a+b and increased GS-activity (I-form) in skeletal muscle (P < 0.01). Acipimox decreased phosphorylation of GS (site 3a+b) (P < 0.02) and increased GS-activity (P < 0.01) in muscle. Conclusion: The present study provides direct evidence that suppression of lipolysis in patients with HIV-lipodystrophy improves insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose-uptake. The increased glucose-uptake may in part be explained by increased dephosphorylation of GS (site 3a+b) resulting in increased GS activity.				cross over design					Philippe Rocca-Serra

The treatments are combinations of levels of the factors. The advantages of factorial designs over one-factor-at-a-time experiments is that they are more efficient and they allow interactions to be detected. In statistics, a factorial design experiment is an experiment whose design consists of two or more factors, each with discrete possible values or levels, and whose experimental units take on all possible combinations of these levels across all such factors. Such an experiment allows studying the effect of each factor on the response variable, as well as the effects of interactions between factors on the response variable.		http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/steps/glossary/anova.html#facdes And from wikipedia (01/03/2007): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_experiment)						MSI			PMID: 17582121-Our objective was to examine the effects of dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) with different concentrations of dietary crude protein (CP) on performance and acid-base status in early lactation cows. Six lactating Holstein cows averaging 44 d in milk were used in a 6 x 6 Latin square design with a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments: DCAD of -3, 22, or 47 milliequivalents (Na + K - Cl - S)/100 g of dry matter (DM), and 16 or 19% CP on a DM basis. Linear increases with DCAD occurred in DM intake, milk fat percentage, 4% fat-corrected milk production, milk true protein, milk lactose, and milk solids-not-fat. Milk production itself was unaffected by DCAD. Jugular venous blood pH, base excess and HCO3(-) concentration, and urine pH increased, but jugular venous blood Cl- concentration, urine titratable acidity, and net acid excretion decreased linearly with increasing DCAD. An elevated ratio of coccygeal venous plasma essential AA to nonessential AA with increasing DCAD indicated that N metabolism in the rumen was affected, probably resulting in more microbial protein flowing to the small intestine. Cows fed 16% CP had lower urea N in milk than cows fed 19% CP; the same was true for urea N in coccygeal venous plasma and urine. Dry matter intake, milk production, milk composition, and acid-base status did not differ between the 16 and 19% CP treatments. It was concluded that DCAD affected DM intake and performance of dairy cows in early lactation. Feeding 16% dietary CP to cows in early lactation, compared with 19% CP, maintained lactation performance while reducing urea N excretion in milk and urine.				factorial design					Philippe Rocca-Serra

However we see several issues with this. First of all the name 'probe' might not be used in OBI. Instead we have a 'reporter' role. Also, albeit the term 'probe intensity' is often used in communities such as the microarray one, the name 'probe' is ambiguous (some use it to refer to what's on the array, some use it to refer to what's hybed to the array). Furthermore, this concept could possibly be encompassed by combining different OBI terms, such as the roles of analyte, detector and reporter (you need something hybed to a probe on the array to get an intensity) and maybe a more general term for 'measuring intensities'. We need to find the right balance between what is consistent with OBI and combinations of its terms and what is user-friendly. Finally, note that 'intensity' is already in the OBI .owl file and is also in PATO. Why didn't OBI import it from PATO? This might be a problem.							fluorescent reporter intensity					person:Chris Stoeckert

Haplotype can be determined also as the genetic constitution of an individual chromosome. In the case of diploid organisms such as humans, the haplotype will contain one member of the pair of alleles for each site.\nAddition :\nA haplotype is a genetic information content which corresponds to the genetic constitution of an individual chromosome (in diploid species); one member of a pair of alleles for each loci.\nWhen haplotypes are defined with relation to SNPs, the definition changes: a haplotype is a set of SNPs found to be statistically associated on a single chromatid. That is, adjacent SNPs that are inherited together on the basis of linkage disequilibrium.

Using the same food intake data and the expanded National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute food composition data base, these analyses of sources of variance have been expanded to include classes of carbohydrate, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, total ash, caffeine, and crude fiber. The analyses relate to observed intakes (replicated six times) of 30 adult males and 30 adult females obtained under a paired Graeco-Latin square design with sequence of interview, interviewer, and day of the week as determinants. Neither sequence nor interviewer made consistent contribution to variance. In females, day of the week had a significant effect for several nutrients. The major partitioning of variance was between interindividual variation (between subjects) and intraindividual variation (within subjects) which included both true day-to-day variation in intake and methodological variation. For all except caffeine, the intraindividual variability of 1-day data was larger than the interindividual variability. For vitamin A, almost all of the variance was associated with day-to-day variability. One day data provide a very inadequate estimate of usual intake of individuals.

Four groups of rats were arranged in a 2x2 factorial design with 2 levels of Social procedure (Intermittent Social vs Continuous Social) and 2 levels of sipper Liquid (Ethanol vs Water). Intermittent Social groups received 35 trials per session. Each trial consisted of the insertion of the sipper tube for 10 s followed by lifting of the guillotine door for 15 s. The guillotine door separated the experimental rat from the conspecific rat in the wire mesh cage during the 60 s inter-trial interval. The Continuous Social groups received similar procedures except that the guillotine door was raised during the entire duration of the session. For the Ethanol groups, the concentrations of ethanol in the sipper [3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16% (vol/vol)] increased across sessions, while the Water groups received 0% ethanol (water) in the sipper throughout the experiment. Both Social procedures induced more intake of ethanol than water. The Intermittent Social procedure induced more ethanol intake at the two highest ethanol concentration blocks (10-12% and 14-16%) than the Continuous Social procedure, but this effect was not observed with water. Effects of social stimulation on ethanol drinking are discussed.				2x2 factorial design					Philippe Rocca-Serra
