Hobart Press, Summit, New Jersey, pp. 94-101.			The term loess is short for localized regression.  It refers to fitting a polynomial (straight line, quadratic, cubic, etc) to data values within a window covering a fraction of the total number of observations.  As the window slides along the axis, a new polynomial is fit to the observations falling within the window.  This continues until all points are fit with a local polynomial.  The results are then smoothed together to form a curve.  The smoothness of loess fits is controlled by a smoothing parameter (often denoted as alpha, usually between ¼ and 1) and the degree of the polynomial that is fitted by the method (usually denoted by lambda).

Partial least squares regression is an extension of the multiple linear regression model (see, e.g., Multiple Regression or General Stepwise Regression). In its simplest form, a linear model specifies the (linear) relationship between a dependent (response) variable Y, and a set of predictor variables, the X's, so that\nY = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bpXp\nIn this equation b0 is the regression coefficient for the intercept and the bi values are the regression coefficients (for variables 1 through p) computed from the data.
