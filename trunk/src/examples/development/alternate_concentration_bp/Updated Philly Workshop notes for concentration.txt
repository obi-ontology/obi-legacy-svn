- introduce child class of PBS buffer: 10X PBS (thelabrat.com protocol)
http://www.thelabrat.com/protocols/4.shtml

- add relations: specified output of some material combination and realizes concretization of protocol
- capture that protocol is encoded in document (web page)


- for PBS buffer: change the use of concentration relations: 
has_quality some ('molecular concentration' and towards some 
('scattered molecular aggregate' and ('has grain' only 'sodium phosphates')))

- for PBS 10X buffer: change 'molecular concentration' to 'concentration of N/Mol' towards ... according to recipe. 

- Ask Alan: Why are we reneging on this in the Fucoidan investigation? molecular concentration would be perfect there. analogously, it is unclear why the 'measurement of' relation is needed there. 
- Alan: Propose: manufactured molecular mixture --> is expected to pass some measurement quality control. Less problem with concentrations.
