Participants: TW, RB, LF, JW, JFRyan - The iterative process of building FuGO works well for Flow Cytometry community. The terms currently proposed were seen of value.RB - 2 terms proposed as a result of review of existing "Study terms" for FuGOTERM 1-algorithm_testing_objective - separate from software_testing_objectiveLF - relation to software_testing_objectiveRB - disjoint OR change the def of software_... to include algorithmsLF - to biologists they think algorithm, perhaps it is better to change defJW - can't test an alg unless it is in software...RB - extend the definition???LF - if alg... it is kind of software_testing... then subclass IF PART_OF then make a siblingRB - subclass of software_testing_objectiveLF - where does version fit in?JW - software_testing... since this is testing diff. software, don't usually test different ACTION ITEM: RB - re-write def for software_testing_obj as agreed upon to account for algorithmsTERM 2model_testing_objective - The aim of a study or experiment (investigation?),designed to test whether a previously generated predictive model is suitable (e.g., sensitive, specific) for a particular biological condition.TW - place in hierarchy?RB - protocol_testing_objective is biological and/or design of exp.LF - imp. for grants to have hypothesisRB - fishing expedition to find markers for disease state using Flow Cyt., we found these markers and are now doing a R01 to test thisLF - the study can have a direction or it can be exploratoryRB - hypothesis - generating and testing as children terms to hypothesisLF - hypoth_generating and hypoth_testingACTION ITEMRe-do def for model_testing... to include the word hypoth so that it is explicit!Are 2 terms needed - one for generating AND one for testing? RB - types of investigation is nice would be whole genomic (using over 80% of the genes) OR subset of the genesACTON ITEM - work with Liju and Helen P./Kara Dolinsky (Yeast community) to find name for whole genome type of investigation=-=-=-=-=-=-=Study and TimelineJennifer Fostel-Missing from MAGEv1 was the concept of time, this was handled by it being a new material, Example from CT was that there are some things were the time was not importantJW - the samples were collected at some point in time, but it was being ignored so add this to study and ignore when possibleAGREEMENT to keep the idea of timeline in ontologyPROPOSE: timeline - put under design, sibling to study_design, definition - see JW tracker postJW - history of events, JF - interval of time using the same term nameJF - could use diff terms, timeline_record and timeline_construct, OK to have 2 termsLF - historical_timeline????JW - record of events is how it is proposed JF - separate by clock time and study timeline (intervals), history - refers to past; timeline_real-time - parent is timeline, parent is design timeline_interval - parent is timeline, parent is designNOTE: propose terms in capitals for visual marker that this is a proposed name, it is ugly but is a placeholderJW - other terms...JF - has duration rather than interval (start and end time)JF - interval can be ambiguousJW - can we have both terms? yes - an interval has a start and an end and the duration only needs one of theseAGREE on timestampLF - date, month and day of the week??? JF - week is the intervalACTION ITEM: JW - tidy up definitions for "time" terms as posted in the tracker, TW - set-up JF as a SF developer, assign "time" terms to JFNext week's call:Review "Study terms" as proposed by the Toxicogenomics community as presented by Jennifer
