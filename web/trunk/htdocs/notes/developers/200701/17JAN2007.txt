Disjoints and BFO stuff
* Had a discussion with Pierre and other BFO people about what to do. Liju says we have an agreement on how to approach this.
* We need to know the BFO better, and know what they intend for the sub-ontologies. Some OBI classes were written down as BFO siblings, which is not correct with respect to BFO's intentions.
* Daniel imported BFO into OBI. All the lighter-colored class icons are the BFO terms. You can see "snap:", which is the original form from BFO.
* BFO defines Entity as union of continuant and occurrent. That's the full definition. Everything under entity must be one of these two types. This means we should not add any siblings, according to their rules.
* Similarly, continuant is composed ENTIRELY of dependent_continuant, independent_continuant, and spatial_region. This means that continuant covers these three things, and these three subclasses are disjoint.
* We get a problem when we look at the subclasses of independent_continuant, as we have added more terms as siblings of independent_continuant's children.
* Either they can cover more loosely, or we ask them to add more siblings. Both of these are problematic and may be difficult. We would have to make a very strong argument to add another sibling to BFO.
* At the moment, "document" does not fit in, and the reasoner would complain due to the disjoint assignments for independent_continuant.
* Alan said he has run OBI through the reasoner.
* We need to determine, during the workshop, if those that are incorrectly placed WRT BFO should be moved or if we should apply to BFO for an addition.
* There are many such "OBI siblings" that will have to be dealt with. Alan has made a list of such terms. However, Alan ran his program on the latest version of obi in svn, which is not the latest, as Trish was waiting for confirmation from obi-coord before she could commit the most recent versions with the new definitions.
* Alan believes that environment was going to go to the trash can - right now, take it as a stub, as it will get developed more fully elsewhere, in an environment ontology.
* Liju has a small set of terms she think would be easiest to change:
? document has two subclasses, protocol_document and record. We think we can just put it under "object"
* Liju thinks that it is too early to put in disjoints, and that we should wait until it is more mature, and also until we understand BFO more.
* We need to figure out where electronic documents go. We should ask BFO mailing list to tell us where things like emails go. Additionally, we should describe how we imagine using email as well as asking where it should go. Is it a verb or a noun? Software is another such problematic example.
? In the case of Software, there is an NCBC project creating a formalism for describing various types of Software. Barry is involved (part of the ontology recommendation group). Critical there for re-use of software.
* For more technical terms, like mass spec terminology, we should cite a paper that uses the term so that non-specialists can understand what we are trying to define and place in the hierarchy.
* design_specification should probably be renamed to design. Experimental design and protocols are not the same thing. 
* The definition should tell you something about the disjoints etc as well as its parent.

ACTION ITEMS/OBI CHANGES:
* Move “document” and all subclasses: FROM child of independent_continuant TO child of object.
? Question: what about electronic documents?
? Question: Should records be child of document?
? Question: Should protocol_document be a child of record?
* possible changing of name from design_specification to design. Suggest that Jennifer looks at this term and figure out everything you meant by it, and then re-evaluate its position.
* Still a lot of work to be done on the data transformation terms. Please look at the DT email sent around, and send any comments back, especially regarding questionable terms, before next week's teleconference. Example of a questionable term inside DT is "probe".
* go through all OBI siblings of BFO and see if we can find other places for them to go. This will be the main call topic for next week's devel call.
* Schedule a session in the meeting to do a review of existing terms.
