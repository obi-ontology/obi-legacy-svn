OBI Developers Call - 03JAN2007
Agenda: Finalize Metadata Discussion as needed for San Diego workshop action items

Participants: Ally Lister (AL), Trish Whetzel (TW), Daniel Schober (DS), Philip Rocca-Serra (PRS), Ryan Brinkman (RB), Daniel Rubin (DR), Chris Stoeckert (CS), Kevin Clancy (KC), Joe White (JW)* How to write provenance of definitions?o DS would prefer just one provenance. We select and choose them, and they belong to our ontology then.o Allyson worried that if we take the definition from somewhere we should mention that source.o Chris: Overall discussion believes that we don't need to put in a citation unless using a significant chunk of it.o Other groups can extend OBI and have their own terms and provenance.o Philippe suggested that we could use alternative_definition if different communities have different definitionso Trish suggests that the original usage for alternative_definition is just for display purposes - something for specific communities of users to see, without having to see the OBI definition. Alternative_definition comments must be linked to a community.o Summary: Chris' point is the overall winner: if just one source, with the Aristotelian definition format preceding it, cite that source. If many sources, it is the OBI Editor that has made the final definition and just use OBI as the definition_source. Source/provenance, URL and date accessed will be added when possible.
* Where does the provenance go?o Should it be stored as a complex value (holding definition, and definition source), or in a simple way, with separate annotation tags for each bit of information?o PRS asked if the plugin developed by NCIT to add complex values was easy to use. DR and others were asked if they are familiar with this plugin. Seems that those on the call haven't tried it out yet.o DR asked why not have the annotation property for definition be of type Object (object property type), which would have two things: the actual definition and definition_source?o DR also mentioned that the NCIT plugins may very NCIT-specific and to keep that in mind.o The plugin in question is one that Gilberto suggested and hopefully is one that has a more universal audience, but this needs to be checked into.o Summary: change all "defprov:" to "definition_source:" for all definitions. This will be a temporary, simple way of doing things until the final decision is made with respect to objects/complex values/simple values. Trish will then add and move all definitions to the new definition annotation property.
* autoIDs for properties: find someone to modify the autoID plugin, so that we can have IDs (an autoID plugin) also for properties? Trish will look to it, but perhaps Nick Drummond could do it for us. At the moment only works for Classes.

* DS: Preferred_name is the most intuitive one to the domain expert, and is the one with the highest usage frequency. At the moment, the rdfs:label is our preferred_name. There are other sorts of names, though, as mentioned in RuMetadataRefinedRefined. o For the time being, just use preferred name (now captured as rdfs:label) and will be moved, not copied, to our annotation property preferred_name.o Then, for public consumption, there would be code that would add the term into the rdfs:label so that the public would see the preferred name in both places.

* Discussion on including "curation status" annotation property in OBI similar to the usage in BIRN. A few values for this property are: graph position temporary, uncurated, curation satisfactory. Daniel Rubin will make sure we have a list of definitions of all of these terms.

* Put structure of new definitions (how to write) on the wiki so that all are familiar with the format of the definition and the file so that these can be loaded in batch. * Action Item Summaryo PRS - obtain comments or Protégé plugin for adding in complex values, as proposed for use with the definitionso TW - work to set-up the function of automatically generating identifiers as is done with classes using the AutoID plugino DR - contact BIRN group about the definition of the curation_status tagso Ally - add to the wiki (SanDiego Workshop Action Items) the format of the file that is used for the list of definitionso DS - send list of agreed on annotation properties, a propsed definition for these and the type (object vs datatype, information as to the actual implementation) to the obi-devel list
