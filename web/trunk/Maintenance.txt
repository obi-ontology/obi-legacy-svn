This is a document that should NOT go onto the shell.sourceforge.net server. Its job is to tell OBI Administrators
how they must upload changes to the server for the static pages.

UPDATE: SOURCEFORGE NOW ALLOWS DIRECT SUBVERSION ACCESS TO SHELL.SOURCEFORGE.NET. 

This means that /home/groups/o/ob/obi/htdocs and /home/groups/o/ob/obi/include are now subversion directories, and
once you've made and committed a change to your local checkout, you should just be able to update the subversion directory
directly on shell.sourceforge.net. Please let me know if you have any problems.
