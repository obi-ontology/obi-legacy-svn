This is a document that should NOT go onto the shell.sourceforge.net server. Its job is to tell OBI Administrators
how they must upload changes to the server for the static pages.

Unfortunately, Sourceforge do not allow direct subversion access to shell.sourceforge.net. Therefore, in order to get
your changes from this SVN directory onto the shell.sourceforge.net server, please follow the following steps:

1. Test ALL of your changes on your local system. If you need help setting up php on your system, Allyson Lister has
had some experience with it on the ubuntu Linux OS, so you can contact her. However, she doesn't know much about
other OS's so you may need to look it up. There should NEVER be broken code committed to this branch. It all must
work properly prior to commit, as a person other than you might need to regenerate the files on shell.sourceforge.net
from the SVN directory at any time.

2. Commit your code to SVN. Please use an appropriately descriptive commit message.

3. Copy the appropriate files/directories into /home/groups/o/ob/obi on shell.sourceforge.net. There are a few ways to
do this, two of which are presented here.
    3a. Use your favorite copy mechanism (such as scp) to copy only those files and/or directories that you have
        modified.
    3b. If there are a lot of changes, you can copy htdocs/ and the include/ directories en-masse. scp or rsync
        works well for this. Further instructions for rsync follow.

        + Check that the command you're using is correct, and is performing exactly how you would expect with the
        changes you have just made to the checkout using the following "dry-run" command:

        rsync -e ssh --verbose --dry-run --recursive --exclude='.svn' --delete htdocs username@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/o/ob/obi/
        rsync -e ssh --verbose --dry-run --recursive --exclude='.svn' --delete include username@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/o/ob/obi/

        + *Carefully* study the output, and if it looks like it's doing the right thing, please continue to the *real*
        run command, that will actually modify things on shell.sourceforge.net:

        rsync -e ssh --verbose --recursive --exclude='.svn' --delete htdocs username@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/o/ob/obi/
        rsync -e ssh --verbose --recursive --exclude='.svn' --delete include username@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/o/ob/obi/
